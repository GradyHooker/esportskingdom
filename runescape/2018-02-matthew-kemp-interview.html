</div>

<p class="interview-question">Grady (The Idiots Lantern): So, obviously as we just said, fifth anniversary of Old School. How did you find your way onto the Old School team at RuneScape?</p>
<p>Matthew Kemp: Well, the whole story with me and RuneScape starts in 2004. It's my wife's fault completely why I work here, I blame her for it every day. She said "Man, you should come play this game called RuneScape, it's really good fun" so I started playing with my wife and about a year later a job came up in the local newspaper that said "Do you want to work for Jagex?" and my wife applied for it. She didn't get it and told me I had to apply for it and being the dutiful husband that I was, I didn't have a choice, so I applied for it and got the job and I've been here ever since. Back in 2012 when the discussions were going around about Old School RuneScape and how we were going to bring it back, so at the very end of the year, and I went to my boss (I was community manager at the time). I went to my boss who was the head of communities and said "Get me the Old School gig, because that's the game I love and really enjoy, I want to be on that." He did and since then that's where I have been ever since.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Nice, so to you is Old School a different game or is it just a different version of the same game?</p>
<p>It's a different experience of RuneScape. Imagine RuneScape is this wonderful thing, because obviously I have accounts in the main RuneScape as well because that's where I started playing so I've got a nice big high-level account in there. When I played at one point I was in the top 10,000 players at one point, which was a wonderful achievement, but that was years ago. To me it's just another way of playing or integrating with this world that we have, that is RuneScape.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Five years, it's a long time, what's your favorite bit of content that you're able to release in those five years?</p>
<p>Cor blimey, okay, I think it's got to be Deadman and I'll tell you why. It's because back in 2007 I used to love PKing and I used to go out with my clan PKing and walk around the wilderness, you're heart would be going the entire time because you knew it was a PvP area and you knew at any time you could get killed and your heart was going and you got that tension, you were sweating, and it was this wonderful experience of just drama and I wanted to bring that to the game everywhere. So, I came up with this idea of Deadman Mode which was a PvP anywhere world, where if you died you lost absolutely everything; so you lost your XP, you lose your bank, you lose your items you were carrying to really make people get that sense of fear and trepidation when they're going out there. It all came from me having a chat with the players through a live stream, I said "This is an idea I've had and I would love to do it" and the players just went "That's amazing, yeah, let's do that." So we asked them what we should call it and they came up with the name of Deadman, somebody sort of shouted it in the chat and I was like "Okay, we will call it Deadman." It went live and they went absolutely nuts for it and that's probably my favorite thing thats happened in five years.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Old School has a huge focus on that polling and that community feedback. How do you feel that's changed the development of the game?</p>
<p>It's been a very focused development I think, one thing that we always have to consider when we are coming up with ideas of what to make and what to poll to players is do they want it or do will they enjoy it. That's the key thing it changes what you want to do to take it out off "I think this would be cool" to "I think the players would like this" and that functional change that there's this fundamental change in how you think and that that's changed everything from not necessarily making things which are good game design in the industry sense of the word to something which we know the players would enjoy but if we were to have come up with it through a whole load of game designers everything else it would never have happened. So, it just fundamentally changed how we work.

<p class="interview-question">Talking about community I asked the subreddits whether there was any questions and one of them asked if, on the stream of Deadman there, "Are you planning on any new competitive PvP content in the future perhaps with a ranking system"?</p>
<p>Yeah, we actually got plans for that now, I think we spoke about, did we talk about that at RuneFest? No we didn't speak about it at RuneFest - we were going to, but didn't quite. But we came up with a proper ELO system to help players be able to help us identify the best PvPers basically so that we can then pull those people that make really exciting content and competitions and it allows anyone to sort of get better at PKing and get themselves to a level where they can enter these competitions that's something
we're working on, we should have news to the players more about that later on this year</p>

<p class="interview-question">With unlimited resources where do you see Old School going in the next five years?</p>
<p>Cor blimey, if I could do anything I wanted to, the one thing I'd like to do would be to give more opportunities to players to design their own content so giving them tools and giving them features so they can make their own quests almost like they could have they could have a test world where they could build stuff and then we could go into it and have a look at the really cool stuff and then take the players content and put it into the game and really get the players much more involved in making the game and being a part of creating this this world of RuneScape.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Sounds cool, it's sort of like what some games do with the Steam Workshop where you can upload maps or gun finishes and types like that and I think that sounds like a cool idea where it is the community's game.</p>
<p>Yep no, absolutely, I think that would be an absolutely wonderful thing. The problem we've got and this is one of the big problems that we face constantly is the tech that we're built on is sort of an amalgamation of tech from 2002 to 2013 so plugging into a Steam Workshop is all very well and good if if you're making a brand new game from scratch, but when you're dealing with the stuff that we have to deal with it's it's probably a lot easier for us to do ourselves than plug into somebody else so it's not a small thing by any means. But it's something I would love to get to.

<p class="interview-question">Talking about potentially working on top again and going to another platform we've got mobile on the horizon. How long has mobile being an idea that you've wanted to do?</p>
<p>Three, four years now. The first, I'm trying to think when we had the first discussion about it. It would have been very soon after Old School happened because we always knew it was something that wasn't thing. The first time we got really serious about it, probably talking...I remember sitting in a meeting with the executive team where it was discussed and that could have been a few years back, but it's taken a long time to get it to where it is now. It's not been an easy thing by any means but yeah it's something we think we've always wanted to do and it's just got more and more serious over the last five years until we're in a position now where it's going to happen basically.

<p class="interview-question">So, we keep talking about when it comes out. We've had a beta, when can people expect to get their hands on mobile again?</p>
The problem with mobile is it's very difficult to give exact dates for it. Because what we're doing is we're creating something that no one's ever done before - we're taking this tech, like I said before the tech that ranges between 2000 to 2013, making it work on a modern platform which is mobile. So we're coming up with, and we also try and make it work on PC at the same time, so it's got this complete interoperability as well and the problem we've got is we're facing issues that no one else has had before. So the way we sort of look at what we can guarantee is going to happen is if we look about two weeks in the future we know what the client will look like and how it will work in two weeks time, the three weeks time we're a little bit more fuzzy because something might come up which no one's ever thought of before that we have to get past, now four weeks time gets a little more fuzzy and then five, six, seven. So it's very difficult to give times for it we want to do more betas we want to get more betas out to players as soon as possible, obviously. But as for the dates of when that will happen, I couldn't honestly couldn't tell you with any great clarity at all.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Would there be any mobile exclusive content or would mobile just be a new client for the same experience?</p>
<p>It's a new platform, but it's the same game so the games will be the same game world you'll be playing on the whole idea is exactly the same game on PC that you can play on mobile and there's no plans to make either different in that regard, the only differences you'll see is going to be UI. Because obviously you'll need better UI on mobile.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Would there, because it is a mobile game at that point, would there be any leaning towards ads or microtransactions or anything like that?</p>
Microtransactions are not going to be a thing. We are very attuned to the community on what they want in-game, so we know how they feel about microtransactions as they perceive them. If they change their mind and decide they want it, then yes we'll do it, but I can't see that happening anytime soon. So microtransactions will happen if the community wants it and in the way the community wants it, so that will happen across both platforms. Ads is not something we've decided on yet.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Do you have any idea what sort of new user base this would bring in, in terms of numbers, or has there been any sort of estimation or talk about that?</p>
<p>We've got our ideas but it's based on lots of different bits of information. We can't be one hundred sure about about it. It's gonna be big, we know it's gonna be big. What our plan is to identify how many people we're going to get is we're going to go into a soft launch process where we launch it in several territories and then we measure what happens there and then we'll scale it up to understand what it will do for the community as a whole. But it's as I said before no one's ever done this before so it's put your finger in the air and see what happens really. But we're going to test it properly make sure that we know exactly what's going to happen when it goes out to full launch so we can scale with the servers we need to make sure that everyone can play it.</p>

<p class="interview-question">So you've talked about the building on old tech for mobile and for general development in Old School. Is there anything in mobile that's been particularly touch to work with this old tech and try to get done?</p>
<p>There has been nothing that has been particularly easy, that's for sure. The biggest issue is, I mean it is all tech-based, it's one of the great things about Old School is it's a very small game so when you talk about data sizes, size of the client - they're all very small because they were designed to work on really old computers, so there that's that's a problem we didn't have. However because we're on such old tech we had to basically rewrite the entire client to make it a thing which has caused issues. We also have been working on getting it to run off graphics processors rather than your your core computer processors and that's been a challenge, but again we've got it into such a good place that runs so smoothly on mobile, in fact on some mobile phones we have it running out in eighty-five frames per second, which is absolutely crazy. So that's a massive plus which hopefully after mobile comes out we can back-port onto PC as well so the PC users can start using their GPUs rather than the CPUs. 101 things have been complicated to get past, I don't think that I could pull out one which is been particularly difficult, but yeah a massive challenge, but we are definitely getting there.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Old School is getting, got, a brand new Twitch channel coming out. Is there any plans for more content on Twitch or are we just moving the old school content over to a new channel?</p>
<p>There will be more content, there are plans to have more streams, more regular streams, different types of streams, refreshing the existing streams as well. The first stream is tonight on the new channel that starts at 7:00 p.m. GMT - there will be lots of talk on there about what we plan to do.</p>
 
<p class="interview-question">One final question from the subreddit, can you confirm yours and Emily's plans to get a cat for the office?</p>
<p>I can't, no.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Thanks for having a chat with us today</p>
<p>No problem at all mate.</p>

<p class="interview-question">I'll let you get back to work.</p>
<p>Thanks very much.</p>
