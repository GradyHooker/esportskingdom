<p>It was a scary start at IEM Katowice 2022 for Fnatic with an early loss, but they managed to claw it back and keep their dreams alive. We talk to KRIMZ about what the new roster has been like and if the transition is easy or not, then take a look at their future in the tournament.</p>

<p>Fnatic made a series of bold roster moves in the latter half of 2021, bringing in the British trio of Alexander "ALEX" McMeekin, William "mezii" Merriman and Owen "smooya" Butterfield to complete their roster alongside Freddy "KRIMZ" Johansson and Ludvig "Brollan" Brolin. The team surpassed expectations at first, yet poor online results to kick off 2022 left them in uncertain form heading into IEM Katowice. </p>

<p>For KRIMZ, this is a chance to earn a third trophy inside the Spodek. We were able to talk to KRIMZ about his long-awaited departure from the Swedish scene:</p>

<p class="interview-question">Josh: You've spent most of your career up to this point playing for Swedish rosters, but now you're playing for sort of a mix with Swedish and Brits. How has the transition been onto this new roster with these British players, has it been weird leaving the Swedish scene?</p>
<p><span class="bold">KRIMZ</span>: Not really weird, but for sure a change in how you approach Counter-Strike and how you play â€” and of course, the language as well. As Brollan said before it's getting better and better after each week we practice or after every event, but it's for sure a new experience. I mean, it's fun to discover new things, right?</p>

<p>In the opening round, Fnatic were surprised by the Copenhagen Flames, taking a 16-7 loss in the first match of the event. Facing elimination, Fnatic quickly refocused and recovered against Wisla Krakow, defeating the Polish squad in 2-0 fashion. In the final round of the play-in stage, Fnatic is set to face BIG in the following round, an opponent that won't give them an easy route to victory.</p>
