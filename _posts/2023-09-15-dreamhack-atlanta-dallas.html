<p>DreamHack unveils 2024 U.S. festival dates: Dallas (May 31-June 2) and Atlanta (October 4-6). Guy Blomberg, a seasoned events pro, leads with experience from E3, PAX, Comic-Con, and beyond. Exciting times ahead for DreamHack in the Americas!</p>

<p>In a significant development, DreamHack, an ESL FACEIT Group (EFG) brand, has appointed Guy Blomberg as the Event Director for DreamHack Festivals in the Americas. Drawing on his extensive experience in leadership roles at events such as E3, PAX, Comic-Con, and more, Blomberg will play a pivotal role in overseeing DreamHack's North American festivals as they gear up for an exciting 2024 schedule that includes festival returns in Dallas (June 2024) and Atlanta (Oct 2024). Notably, the 2023 DreamHack Atlanta festival is set to take place from December 15-17.</p>

<p>Reflecting on his new role, Blomberg expressed his enthusiasm, stating</p>
<p class="quote">DreamHack is such an established and beloved brand, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to take the reins of its North American festivals. It’s been a unique period for gaming events worldwide in recent years, but it’s evident just how important it still is for the community to come together in person and celebrate their passion. I’ve assembled a dynamic team brimming with innovative ideas to elevate these events into more meaningful experiential gatherings, and I look forward to the journey ahead."</p>

<p>Bringing a wealth of experience to his new position, Blomberg has held directorial roles at renowned gaming and live events like E3, PAX, Comic-Con, EGX, and more. His profound understanding of the gaming industry and the desires of fans for in-person experiences positions him well for this role. Additionally, Blomberg serves as a Board Director of the International Game Developers Association (IGDA) and is the founder of the Games Industry Gathering (GIG) networking group, providing him with a unique perspective on the evolving needs of game developers and advocating for positive industry change.</p>

<p>Shahin Zarrabi, Vice President, Festivals, EFG, expressed the company's excitement, saying</p>
<p class="quote">Guy has orchestrated some of the world’s most renowned gaming events, and we’re thrilled to have his expertise as we shape the future of our festivals in North America. It’s been a standout year for DreamHack in the U.S., and we expect Guy to help elevate the DreamHack experience even further.</p>

<p>Blomberg's vision is to build on the momentum generated by the consecutive record-breaking DreamHack festivals in San Diego (41,000) and Dallas (44,000), carrying it into the upcoming year. In 2024, two of DreamHack's most popular U.S. locations, Dallas (May 31-June 2) and Atlanta (October 4-6), will return as host cities, expanding their array of programming. While the festival won't be returning to San Diego in 2024 due to scheduling challenges, DreamHack remains open to opportunities in California moving forward.</p>

<p>In addition to shaping the 2024 programs, Blomberg is leading the planning for DreamHack Atlanta 2023, scheduled to take place from December 15-17 at the Georgia World Congress Center.
