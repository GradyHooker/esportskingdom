<p>Today DreamHack, an ESL FACEIT Group brand, announced the return of DreamHack Melbourne in 2023. Australia's second-ever DreamHack festival will take place over the weekend of April 28-30, 2023, and will offer a three-day gaming lifestyle experience, with full details of the festival to be announced over the coming months.</p>

<p>The announcement comes two months after the inaugural DreamHack Melbourne festival in Australia concluded successfully, with over 21,000 gaming & esports fans attending across September 2-4, 2022.</p>

<p>Ben Green, Head of Product at ESL FACEIT Group Australia:</p>

<p class="quote">After the resounding success of our first DreamHack down under, we were eager to bring this event back to Melbourne as soon as possible, and at the same time, use this opportunity to move the festival to a more convenient period in the Australian gaming calendar. The DreamHack team both here and overseas were delighted with how the community came together in Melbourne in 2022, and are already hard at work planning how we can make April’s festival a bigger, and more memorable experience for gaming fans, and we can’t wait to share more over the next few months.</p>

<p>It should also be noted that it is likely the ESL Challenger #52 Counter-Strike tournament will likely take place here. The dates for the previously announced 2023 ESL pro Tour CS:GO line up to this new announcement of DreamHack Melbourne 2023.</p>
