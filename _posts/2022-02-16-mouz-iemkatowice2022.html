<p>In Poland, MOUZ has had a fair few shake-ups, so we take a look at their performance after day one in their opening two matches and the future prospects with the opponents lined up for them. We also talk to dexter about this lineup and how it is working from the inside.</p>

<p>MOUZ made significant changes to their starting roster ahead of IEM Katowice, bringing in Nathan "NBK-" Schmitt and Dennis "sycrone" Nielsen to replace star rifler Robin "ropz" Kool and Torbjørn "mithR" Nyborg. Ádám "torzsi" Torzsás was also promoted from the MOUZ NXT academy roster, taking the AWPing role from Frederik "acoR" Gyldstrand. A last-minute COVID-19 case saw Aurimas "Bymas" Pipiras be pulled from the event, to be replaced by MOUZ NXT entry fragger Jon "JDC" de Castro.</p>

<p>When asked about the process of leading this new roster, Christopher "dexter" Nong touched on his experiences with some of his new teammates:</p>

<p class="interview-question">Josh: With this new team, you're working with some veteran players and a lot of new talents as well. For you as the IGL, how has it been developing this roster and getting all the pieces in the right order?</p>
<p><span class="bold">dexter</span>: With the current roster I think with Sycrone and NBK, we've had a good dynamic with how we want to work and we've talked on for many hours on how practice should go and how our goals are aligned and all that kind of stuff. So, it's been quite enjoyable, I've had a lot of help doing my role with these guys and yeah, playing with torszi – yeah, he's cool. He's an amazing player, it's really enjoyable.</p>

<p>Despite their setbacks, MOUZ came out swinging in the opening round, battering GODSENT in a 16-8 affair. Bymas' absence was felt during the next round, however, as they faced the formidable FaZe Clan. It was a close, back-and-forth series, but ultimately FaZe would come out on top 2-1. MOUZ will play the winner of Renegades and Entropiq tomorrow for one of the final four spots in the next stage.</p>
