<p>This December (1st-25th December), Cure Cancer is uniting the Australian gaming community to raise money to fight cancer! Over 25 days people can tune into livestreams from their favourite creators and donate to be in the running to win exclusive swag and the latest game releases.</p>

<p>Cure Cancer is calling all Aussie streamers to get involved with their Holiday Spectacular. All they need to do is host a charity stream on their channels and then engage their audience to raise funds. Streamers just need to go to <a href="https://tiltify.com/cure-cancer-australia/game-on-cancer-holiday-spectacular">Tiltify</a> to sign up and get involved. Unlock XP points for every dollar raised to level up to exclusive MVP merch - it's a win/win for everyone.</p>

<p>Game On Cancer™'s Holiday Spectacular has already recruited hilarious, gaming community channel, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/back_pocket">Back Pocket</a> - as ambassadors for the campaign.</p>

<p>To date, Game On Cancer™ with Cure Cancer has raised over $350,000 for Cancer Research, which is enough to fund 4666 hours of research. Previous fundraisers have included some of Australia's largest names in gaming like Loserfruit, Drewdog and Aussie Antics.</p>

<p>Cure Cancer is dedicated entirely to funding early career researchers and to date has provided over 534 research grants to young researchers with ground-breaking innovative ideas, many who have gone on to become leaders in cancer research globally. The $100k target for the Holiday Spectacular will fund an early career researcher for a year.</p>
