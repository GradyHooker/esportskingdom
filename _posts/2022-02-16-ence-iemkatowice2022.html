<p>It has been a mid start for ENCE as they take a win and a lose, now they must play for their tournament life in the lower bracket. We talk to Spinx about the new lineup and the preparation that they had coming into this tournament and look at their chances going forward.</p>

<p>Katowice 2022 marks ENCE's first tournament of the year, and they look to clean the slate after a disastrous last-place finish at IEM Winter 2021. The team has brought in Pavle "maden" Bošković from FunPlus Phoenix in place of Joonas "doto" Forss, a move that significantly increases the squad's potential firepower. For the two Poles on the roster — Paweł "dycha" Dycha and Aleksander "hades" Miskiewicz — reaching the Spodek and playing in front of the legendary Polish crowd is the only goal.</p>

<p>When asked about their first-round opponents, Entropiq, Lotan "Spinx" Giladi showed no signs of worry:</p>

<p class="interview-question">Josh: Do you feel prepared with this new roster, and how do you feel going up against Entropiq?</p>
<p><span class="bold">Spinx</span>: I think with the time we had to play with this new lineup, we did a lot of work we are pretty prepared – of course, not everything – but compared to a team with a new member, I think we are pretty prepared. The question about Entropiq, it's like also we have a bit of an advantage because we are with a new teammate. They don't know what to expect, meanwhile we know what to expect, kinda. I think it's going to be a good game.</p>

<p>Sure enough, ENCE would be at their best against Entropiq, defeating the Russian squad 16-9. They could not overcome OG in the following round, however, being handily defeated 2-0. With elimination or advancement on the line against GODSENT, ENCE will need to find that first-round form once again.</p>
