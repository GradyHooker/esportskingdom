<p>As the much-anticipated 10th-anniversary celebration of PAX Aus approaches, excitement within the gaming and geek culture community has reached a feverish pitch. In preparation for this milestone event, PAX says there are some last-minute announcements to ensure everyone is well-informed about the thrilling experiences that await.</p>

<p class="subheading">App & Map</p>
<p>First and foremost, PAX says they are delighted to announce the launch of the <a href="https://guidebook.com/app/pax/">PAX Aus app</a>, now available for download from your preferred app store. They strongly encourage attendees to download the app, as it grants easy access to all the vital PAX Aus information, right at your fingertips. With this app, you can meticulously plan your weekend and make the most of your time.</p>

<p>Additionally, PAX invites you to explore the <a href="https://aus.paxsite.com/en-us/expo-hall/map.html">PAX Aus World Map</a>, a valuable tool for navigating the Convention and Exhibition Centre. You can access this map here, giving you a head start on charting your course for the event.</p>

<p class="subheading">Merchandise & Swag</p>
<p>In another exciting update, PAX shares that their merchandise lineup is now up for grabs, featuring a diverse range of items such as tees, hoodies, jackets, bags, lanyards, and cards. Don't miss the return of the iconic Pin Chicken, this year with a nostalgic 'back to the future' twist as Pinny McFly. Adorned with an epic mullet and connected to its trusty walkman, Pinny McFly is the epitome of retro coolness. You can acquire Pinny McFly during the official PAX Aus pin trading sessions in the Queue Hall, daily from 3:00pm to 3:30pm.</p>

<p class="subheading">Meet the Creators</p>
<p>On their schedule, PAX has secured a new Fireside chat with Takuma Endo, Director of Tenchu and President of Acquire Studios. Furthermore, Bethesda's Creative & Game Directors, John Johanas and Rich Lambert, will be sharing insights into the creation of some of Bethesda's most beloved games, including The Elder Scrolls Online and Hi-Fi RUSH. This promises to be a captivating discussion.</p>

<p>The cast of Deerstalker Pictures' renowned Dungeons & Dragons-inspired comedy web-series, '1 For All,' is set to host an engaging panel to answer attendees' burning questions, along with offering a chance for a meet and greet.</p>
