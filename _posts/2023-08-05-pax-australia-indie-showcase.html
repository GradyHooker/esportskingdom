<p>The PAX Aus 2023 Indie Showcase has revealed its captivating lineup, boasting remarkable creativity in game development, storytelling, and character design. Attendees can expect to encounter a plethora of unique and fascinating characters at the Indie Showcase area at PAX Australia.</p>

<p>Bringing together the best of both tabletop and digital gaming worlds, this year's Indie Showcase spotlights four tabletop games and six digital games, each meticulously crafted by talented independent game developers hailing from various corners of the country.</p>
