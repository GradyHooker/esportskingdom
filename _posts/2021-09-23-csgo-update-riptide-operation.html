<p class="subheading">Private Queue</p>

<p>Your own private Premier match on Valve servers. Grab your friends (and friends of friends)!</p>

{% include image.html image="csgo-update-riptide-operation-private" caption="" %}

<p>With a player-generated Queue Code, a group of friends can match amongst themselves into a Premier match on Valve servers. Pair up, form your teams, or solo queue and let the matchmaker sort it out.</p>

<p>Every Steam Group has a Private Queue Code that only its members can use, allowing established Steam Groups to host their private Premier matches on Valve servers. Or make a Steam Group for your network of friends and use existing Steam group tools to manage memberships, have discussions, make announcements, and schedule events. Find an existing Steam Group or create a new one.</p>

<li>Carve Your Own Path: Scavenger hunts, graffiti missions, and more. Make progress by completing items in your checklist in any order you choose.</li>
<li>Race to the Finish: Keep moving. Work your way through a series of checkpoints in order to complete your mission.</li>
<li>Up For a Challenge: Make steady progress in your grind, or complete your mission faster by satisfying a challenge condition!</li>
