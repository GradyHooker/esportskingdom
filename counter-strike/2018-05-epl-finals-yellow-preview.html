      <p>The ESL Pro League regular season is all wrapped up, IEM Sydney is over, and the next stop on the LAN circuit is the Verizon Theater for those teams that qualified for the Pro League Finals.</p>

<p>IEM Sydney had some very interesting shakeups and teams that normally would be looked over now look to be in position to continue making a splash in Dallas. However, that does not mean there are not favorites. Some traditional LAN powers still loom large, and it will take a lot of work for the underdogs to unseat them. Additionally, this will be only the second LAN since the reintroduction of Dust 2 into the competition map pool. This should lead to some interesting matches on that map.</p>

<p>The first of two installments, this article will focus on Group Yellow, both the teams , players to watch, and their first round matches. This group is without a doubt, the stronger of the two groups.</p>

	</div>
</div>

<p class="subheading">The Teams</p>

<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/mousesports.png" alt="Logo for mousesports"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;mousesports&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/mousesports.png" alt="Logo for mousesports"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">mousesports comes into Dallas on fire both online and at LAN. They have only lost 4 matches at LAN since the Boston ELEAGUE Major, and they won StarSeries i-League Season 4 in Kiev and V4 Future Sports Festival in Budapest. Their LAN match losses have come to NiP, NaVi, and Astralis twice. Each of these teams that are performing well at LAN tournaments at the moment. Most recently mouz lost 1-2 to Astralis at IEM Sydney in the Semifinals. In addition to LAN, mouz comes into Dallas as the	1 seed from Europe. They finished with an 18-8 (2-0 in OT) record  with a total of 52 points. They held the tiebreaker over NiP via head-to-head record for the first seed. Their first match is against, Sharks Esports, the winner of the ESL LA League Final.</p>

<p>Player to Watch: Martin ‚ÄúSTYKO‚Äù Styk will be just over a month out of LASIK surgery coming into Dallas. He showed some modest improvement at Sydney over his pre-surgery play. Look to see this improve slightly more as time goes on and he gets used to his better vision. If his play continues to get better and the rest of mouz can maintain their current level of play, we may be crowning a new champ in Dallas.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/navi.png" alt="Logo for Natus Vincere"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Natus Vincere&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/navi.png" alt="Logo for Natus Vincere"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">NaVi is another team that enters Dallas in great form all around. They have placed 3rd of higher in each of their last 4 tournaments, including a 2nd at DreamHack Masters Marseilles losing to Astralis, and a 2nd at Starseries i-League Season 4 in Kiev with a loss to mouz. Online, they placed 3rd in EU Pro League with an 18-8(3-0 in OT) record and 51 points.</p>

<p>Player to Watch: If you've read any of my articles in the past, or watched any of NaVi's matches, you will know who the player to watch is. It is Oleksandr ‚Äús1mple‚Äù Kostyliev who will be center-stage in all of NaVi's matches. If he is on, as he usually is, it takes something special for opposing teams to beat NaVi. However, if he doesn't play out of his mind, the rest of NaVi typically does not make up for his lack of production. NaVi lives and dies by s1mple's AWP. Side stat, as of May 6th, s1mple holds a 1.40 HLTV rating over the last 3 months.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/nrg.png" alt="Logo for NRG Esports"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;NRG Esports&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/nrg.png" alt="Logo for NRG Esports"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">The North American 2 seed comes into Dallas after a rough showing at IEM Sydney, being knocked out in the group stage by losses to Astralis and G2. They performed much better online, securing a 17-5(2-1 OT) record and 50 points in Pro League NA.</p>

<p>Player to Watch: Vincent ‚ÄúBrehze‚Äù Cayonte is the most consistent player on the team, and if NRG are to make a run at Dallas, they need him to continue to be the rock for the team. He has only had an HLTV rating less than 1.0 in 5 of the last 30 matches.</p>

	</div>
</div>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/faze.png" alt="Logo for FaZe Clan"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;FaZe Clan&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/faze.png" alt="Logo for FaZe Clan"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">Though they come into the LAN as the EU 4th seed, FaZe is arguably the team in the best situation going into Dallas. They finally go the Grand Final monkey off their back in Sydney by sweeping Astralis for only their first International LAN title of the year. In the Pro League their performance has been less than stellar. They come into Dallas with a 15-11(0-2 OT) Pro League record and 51 points.</p>

<p>Player to Watch: How do you pick a player to watch on a team that has outstanding players in all 5 slots, even when they play with a substitute like Xizt? Well, you look to who completely changes the way the team plays when they are alive. For FaZe, that is Ladislav ‚ÄúGuardiaN‚Äù Kov√°cs. Easily a top-3, if not top-2 dedicated AWPer in the world, GuardiaN completely changes the game when he's alive. On CT side, the IEM Sydney HLTV MVP has the ability to lock down a site all on his own. This gives his life so much more value on the CT side. On the T side, his ability to open up sites by getting picks and then holding against the retake adds that same value.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/cloud9.png" alt="Logo for Cloud9"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cloud9&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/cloud9.png" alt="Logo for Cloud9"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">The new Cloud9 has not performed well at LAN since the loss of Stewie2K. The NA 4th seed was swept by Gambit in the Quarterfinals of DH Masters Marseilles, and was bounced from IEM Sydney in the Group Stage after a poor showing against TyLoo and FaZe, being swept by both teams. They have a 13-9(1-2 OT) record with 40 points in the Pro League.</p>

<p>Player to Watch: For Cloud9 the player that must return to Major/pre-Major form is AWPer Tyler ‚ÄúSkadoodle‚Äù Latham. In the last 2 LANs he has posted a .95 and .90 HLTV rating. During and Before the ELEAGUE Boston Major his rating was consistently .20 better. His performance is vital to C9 successfully navigating the dangerous group stages. If he, along with new addition, Pujan ‚ÄúFNS‚Äù Mehta, do not turn their performance around, look to see another group stage failure from the reigning Major Champs.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/heroic.png" alt="Logo for Heroic"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Heroic&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/heroic.png" alt="Logo for Heroic"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">Heroic takes over the spot for HellRaisers after √ñzg√ºr ‚Äúwoxic‚Äù Eker could not get visa issues cleared. They finished 8th in EU with a 14-12(4-1 in OT) record and 39 points. Unfortunately, they will be playing without Ruben ‚ÄúRUBINO‚Äù Villaroel due to an eye infection. However Adam ‚Äúfriberg‚Äù Friberg has officially been signed full time.</p>

<p>Player to Watch: The player to watch on this late entry to Dallas is without a doubt Adam ‚Äúfriberg‚Äù Friberg. He brings a lot of high-level CS experience to the team. It will be vital for him to both perform well, and assist in running the team effectively. Not much is expected of this team after their sudden replacement of HellRaisers, and the sale of two of their top players to OpTic, but friberg can lead them to an upset or two if teams do not prepare.</p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">Dallas is only the third big International LAN for MVP PK. They got their first real taste of the big leagues at WESG 2017 here they were knocked out in the Quarterfinals by Fnatic. In Sydney they were bounced from the group stages by Fnatic and mouz, but not before they swept Chiefs ESC, another Asia-Pacific team. They took the top seed from Asia-Pacific by beating Australian team, Grayhound gaming 2-1 in the finals of the ESL Pro League Asia-Pacific tournament.</p>

<p>Player to Watch: South Korea has not produced many CS talents, but Kang ‚Äúsolo‚Äù Keun-chul has been the heart and soul of nearly every major South Korean team since the 1.6 days. However, he has seemingly passed the torch to promising player, Lee ‚ÄúXigN‚Äù Hyun-pyo. At 21, he is the youngest player on the MVP roster, but statistically, he has the greatest impact on the team's performance. The team's fortune changes as his play does. If he listens and learns from the older players on the team, he could develop into a very good player and lead MVP to some success in Dallas and future tournaments.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/sharks.png" alt="Logo for Sharks Esports"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharks Esports&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/sharks.png" alt="Logo for Sharks Esports"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">A relatively unknown team, the Sharks show a bit of promise. They secured their spot at Dallas by winning the Final of ESL LA League over Furia eSports in a hard fought 3-1 match that saw two 16-14 games, and one 16-12 game. Of concern for this team will be mental fortitude, as they struggled greatly in closing out matches where they had heavy leads and when they were down big, they seemingly rolled over.</p>

<p>Player to Watch: Formerly the coach for the current SK team when they played for Luminosity, Renato ‚Äúnak‚Äù Nakano is the brains of the team. His experience going all the way back to CS:S is vital to a very young Brazilian team. He is the anchor of the team as he passes on the knowledge and cool-head needed to perform at the highest level. If he's able to keep the younger players focused at their first big LAN, they could end up surprising an unprepared team.</p>

<p class="subheading">The Matches</p>

<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/mousesports.png" alt="Logo for mousesports"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;mousesports&nbsp;&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharks Esports&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/sharks.png" alt="Logo for Sharks Esports"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">As promising as Sharks looks, this one just does not seem winnable for them. Mouz has had too much recent success. Mouz takes it in relatively easy fashion.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/faze.png" alt="Logo for FaZe Clan"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;FaZe Clan&nbsp;&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cloud9&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/cloud9.png" alt="Logo for Cloud9"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">Yet again these two meet in another rematch of the Boston Major Grand Finals. However, C9 has not looked great in their past two tournaments, while FaZe only continues to look better. C9 will make some noise, but ultimately FaZe will win.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/nrg.png" alt="Logo for NRG Esports"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;NRG Esports&nbsp;&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Heroic&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/heroic.png" alt="Logo for Heroic"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">Heroic enters this match a team very different from that which started the season. Missing RUBINO does not help matters. While friberg will get them to put up a fight, I believe NRG takes this match.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/navi.png" alt="Logo for Natus Vincere"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Natus Vincere&nbsp;&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;&nbsp;MVP Project&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/mvp.png" alt="Logo for MVP Project"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">Unfortunate draw for the Korean squad to get NaVi first round. MVP just doesn't have enough firepower to match up with NaVi. However, they may take a couple more rounds off of them than most would think. NaVi wins in convincing fashion.</p>
