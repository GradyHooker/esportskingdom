      <p>With Season 7 of the ESLCS Pro League closing in on the last week of its regular season, it is time to take a look at each of the regions and see who is most likely to make it to the Finals in Dallas, May 18th-20th. In this first installment, North America is the focus. NA Week 7 takes place April 24th-26th.</p>

<p> Remember, only the top 6 teams advance from the North American Region to Dallas.</p>

<p class="subheading">Tickets Punched</p>
<p>North America does not have as much certainty as Europe at this point. Only two teams are already locked into the Finals, Team Liquid and NRG Esports.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/liquid.png" alt="Logo for Team Liquid"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Team Liquid&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/liquid.png" alt="Logo for Team Liquid"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">Liquid has been in great form since the Boston Major. In the ESL Pro League this season they have posted a fantastic record of 16-2 while accumulating 48 points. Of their losses, one came to NRG 22-20, and the other to Luminosity 16-10. Every game so far has been played with Lucas 'steel' Lopes. However, due to the recent acquisition of Epitácio 'TACO' de Melo, and steel's subsequent move to an inactive roster slot, Liquid will have to learn to play together all over again in Week 7. Luckily for Liquid they will get to test themselves against Optic Gaming, the current 3rd place squad. Week 7 will give great insight into how this team will likely perform in the Finals in Dallas.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/nrg.png" alt="Logo for NRG Esports"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;NRG Esports&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/nrg.png" alt="Logo for NRG Esports"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">NRG did not make the Boston Major, but that has not stopped them from performing well this season of ESL Pro League. They have gone 15-5 with 44 points. All 5 losses come to current top 5 teams. Prior to the season they signed ex-CLG player Ethan 'nahtE' Arnold. And at the beginning of March they added Ian 'Immi' Harding as coach. These moves seem to be paying off with solid, consistent performances from nahtE. They only play Luminosity in Week 7, and look to enter the Finals in Dallas with some momentum. The big question for NRG is can they perform on LAN.</p>

<p class="subheading">Should Be In</p>
<p>These teams are very likely to lock in their spot at Dallas. It would take major slip-ups for these teams not to advance.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/optic.png" alt="Logo for OpTic Gaming"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;OpTic Gaming&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/optic.png" alt="Logo for OpTic Gaming"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">The Green Wall should be happy, as Optic looks to be sitting pretty at this point. The squad has performed well this season, with a record of 12-6 and 35 points. However, 2 of those losses are worrying as they came to Rogue and Ghost. While the team did not make the Boston Major, they made a complete roster overhaul prior to the season, signing Peter 'stanislaw' Jarguz, Shahzeeb 'ShahZam' Khan, Kristian 'k0nfig' Wienecke, and René 'cajunb' Borg, as well as loaning Nicklas 'gade' Gade from North Academy. In Week 7 they get the most varied of opponents in 1st place Team Liquid and last place Team Dignitas. A single regular time win will lock them into a spot at Dallas.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/cloud9.png" alt="Logo for Cloud9"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cloud9&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/cloud9.png" alt="Logo for Cloud9"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">The Boston Major Champs are in an interesting situation sitting at 11-7 and 34 points on the season. On March 30th, it was officially announced that Jacky 'Stewie2k' Yip was allowed to leave for SK Gaming, and the same day Tyler 'Skadoodle' Latham caused even more worry among C9 faithful by announcing his retirement from the game, but he has since decided to return to the active roster. They then signed Pujan 'FNS' Mehta to replace Stewie2k. Since the roster moves, the team has not had consistent performances. Despite this, the team faces Rogue and Splyce in Week 7 and only needs a single regular time win over Rogue to advance to Dallas, as they hold a tiebreaker over Luminosity.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/renegades.png" alt="Logo for Renegades"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Renegades&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/renegades.png" alt="Logo for Renegades"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">Renegades performed admirably at the Boston Major New Challengers Stage, but bowed out of the tournament in the Replacement Team Semifinal with a loss to AVANGAR. They currently have a record of 10-6 with 30 points. Only one of their losses has been to a team outside of the top-5. Before the season they picked up Joakim 'jkaem' Myrbostad as a long-term stand-in after losing Keith 'NAF' Markovic to Team Liquid. In Week 7 they play Team Dignitas, Rogue, and SK Gaming. In order to secure a spot, beating Rogue is the most important objective for Renegades. 3 regular time wins with at least one over Rogue would punch their ticket to Dallas without any outside assistance.</p>

<p class="subheading">Work To Do</p>
<p>These teams' fates are all questionable. Either their teamwork isn't where it should be, or they suffer from not having enough points available to guarantee them a spot. Both mean their hopes of advancing are in peril.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/skgaming.png" alt="Logo for SK Gaming"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;SK Gaming&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/skgaming.png" alt="Logo for SK Gaming"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">The super Brazilians had a great performance at the Boston Major, only falling to Faze Clan in the Legends Stage, and Cloud9, the eventual champs, in the semi-finals. However, it seems that performance was not up to the standards of Gabriel 'FalleN' Toledo. and changes were soon to come. On the season, SK sits at a horrid 10-10 with 30 points. After the major, Epitácio 'TACO' de Melo was let go and replaced with the stunning signing of Jacky 'Stewie2K' Yip. The new roster has yet to find a good balance, and has lost to the likes of compLexity Gaming and Splyce. In Week 7 they only play Renegades in two must win games. Even if they win both, that is not a guarantee that they lock up their spot. Unfortunately for the SK faithful, the squad needs some help from others to limit the points that Luminosity and Rogue score this week. Even if they make it to Dallas, it is questionable if they can become a cohesive and consistent team by May 18th.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/luminosity.png" alt="Logo for Luminosity Gaming"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Luminosity Gaming&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/luminosity.png" alt="Logo for Luminosity Gaming"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">The other Brazilian team in the league is in just as precarious a position as SK. They did not make the Major, but also have the most stable roster in North America. For the season, they have an 8-10 record with 25 points.  They have been consistent, with decent performances in nearly all their games this season. They also hold tiebreakers over Rogue, SK Gaming, and Renegades. With Week 7 match-ups against Ghost Gaming and NRG Esports, they hold their fate in their own hands. If they can win out, they will be heading to Dallas over their Brazilian brothers.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/rogue.png" alt="Logo for Rogue"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogue&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/rogue.png" alt="Logo for Rogue"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">Rogue did not make the Boston Major. They have a season record of 7-9 with 21 points. Pickups Hunter 'SicK' Mims and Anthony 'gMd' Gulmond were added prior to the season. To say the team has been highly inconsistent would be a severe understatement. They have sets against Renegades, Cloud9, and Team Dignitas in Week 7. Unfortunately for Rogue, anything less than near perfection will likely mean they will be left at home for the Finals, especially since they only own a tiebreaker over Luminosity Gaming.</p>

<p class="subheading">Left Out</p>
<p>These teams are mathematically eliminated from the Finals.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/complexity.png" alt="Logo for compLexity Gaming"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;compLexity Gaming&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/complexity.png" alt="Logo for compLexity Gaming"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">compLexity Gaming has been mathematically eliminated from Finals contention with a 6-12 record and 18 points. However, they still have something to play for. They must win against Ghost Gaming if they are to avoid relegation. Their other Week 7 opponent is 1st place Team Liquid.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/splyce-2018.png" alt="Logo for Splyce"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Splyce&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/splyce-2018.png" alt="Logo for Splyce"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">Like compLexity, Splyce is mathematically eliminated from the Finals. They have a 6-14 record and 17 points. With only Cloud9 as their opponent in Week 7, it does not look good for Splyce as they look to avoid relegation. If they do not win at least 1 game, they are doomed to relegation.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/ghost.png" alt="Logo for Ghost Gaming"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ghost Gaming&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/ghost.png" alt="Logo for Ghost Gaming"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">Again, another team mathematically eliminated from the Finals. They have a 5-13 record with 16 points, but they also seem to have the easiest match ups out of these three teams. With match-ups against compLexity and Luminosity, they must win at least two games, preferably one of them over compLexity. Otherwise, they will face relegation.</p>

<p class="subheading">Relegated</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/dignitas.png" alt="Logo for Team Dignitas"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Team Dignitas&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/dignitas.png" alt="Logo for Team Dignitas"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">I'm sorry Team Dignitas fans. With a 2-14 record and only 6 points, it is extremely mathematically improbable for Team Dignitas to avoid relegation. We wish you the best of luck in the future. The only thing they can do this week is play spoiler by beating Optic, Renegades, or Rogue.</p>
