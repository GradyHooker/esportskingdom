		Video of Interview with FaZe Clan's karrigan at IEM Sydney
		
	</div>
</div>

<p class="interview-question">Grady: It's a cliche question, but how do you feel?</p>
<p>karrigan: Obviously feeling good. So many times when we have been playing the finals and the confetti in our hair is from the lose of somebody else taking the trophy, so we feel really happy about the win.</p>

<p class="interview-question">I know looking through FaZe Clan's recent results, there are a lot of second places there is a lot of first places as well. Seems like you guys are always consistently in the top, is there anything you can point your finger to towards this consistency?</p>
<p>I think when you look at our trio right now what we have, obviously with Xizt, we have three amazing players in different roles. NiKo is probably the best, most skilled player in the world if you ask me. GuardiaN is probably the best AWPer right now I'd say, he has been really really good in all the finals we have played. And rain is an insane entry fragger, he can just do whatever he wants in the team. So I think the trio fit so good together and obviously with Olof out we have Xizt now supporting a lot of the team. So we tried to adapt our style and we had a hard time to begin with, after we lost Olof, but now we ar ehere winning again and that is because we figured out how to play.</p>

<p class="interview-question">It was an Australian tournament and you were up against some Australian teams at points. You got one map taken off you by Grayhound, was it surprising? Was it something they brought that you didn't expect?</p>
<p>I mean, everyone has picked Grayhound this event and agreed they played really really really well fundamentals - once you play fundamentals really good that is where you can build as a team. Astralis is one of the best fundamental teams and I feel that when you play Grayhound you don't get any easy frags, you can't really get a pick off, so what they did was really good at taking map control and then executing. And if you are players like us we can't really get our peaks before they do the ghost because our teamplay isn't at the same level as other top teams I'd say. But we have so much skill in the team that he can turn around the things for us and that was happening against Grayhound. They were probably one of the hardest teams I played at this tournament, besides Renegades - I feel like we threw that away and they had a good game against us.</p>

<p class="interview-question">So you had the Australian teams in this tournament, now we are looking ahead to Dallas next weekend. ESL have branched out and gone into the Asia-Pacific region, so you got Grayhound again in that one. What do you in terms of the region here in Australasia expanding over there means to them?</p>
<p>I think they have improved a lot from last Sydney. Last Sydney there was obviously Giants who...Chiefs...not Giants, but close. The Chiefs, they beat North in a big upset, but I really feel Grayhound has been the flag for Australia this tournament. Of course Renegades with two Americans, well two non-Australians, but we all know Renegades can CS and can play on a high level. So I think this is a good showing for them, now they have to replicate it in Dallas and this is where it is going to be hard and very tough, because people are going to study them and look at how did they beat SK? how did they get a map off FaZe? and were even close to beating us on the third map. So this is where they have to prove that even though fundamentals are great, people are probably going to know and have an idea about how they play the maps.</p>

<p class="interview-question">IEM Sydney, everyone always talks about the crowd. How's it playing in front of that?</p>
<p>I mean when we lost last time, the crowd here is cheering for great CS, they are cheering for all teams, who wins, who loses, it doesn't matter. All they want is entertainment, intense games and that is what they got today and I feel like there has to be a Sydney, there has to be a Katowice, there has to be a Cologne, because they have epic arenas, epic crowd and they are all different in their own way and that is why I feel it is one of the best arenas I have played in. This tournament shows again how people are open for everything and you can play around and entertain and they are all on it, it is just fantastic. It is really hard to explain.</p>

<p class="interview-question">You seem to love to play with the crowd personally, is that just a motivation boost for you?</p>
<p>I think if I can't hype too much from my team, we have to stay clam, then I try to hype the crowd and I get this good feeling and I feel like sometimes CS is not only about an entertaining match, I think there has to be some people who are rallying the crowd. If many people hate what I do, it is only because I think we need some more entertainment in CSGO and we all know banter can really backfire on Twitter so that is not what I am doing much of, so rallying the crowd and play around with the crowd in pretty fun.</p>

<p class="interview-question">To win the tournament you guys went up against Astralis, long time rivalry, you probably count the amount of times you guys have gone up against them. So what did it mean specifically to take down Astralis? and in the fashion you did? in the Grand Final.</p>
<p>Obviously this is very important for us, because we haven't lost a best-of-three before Marseille for all one year against them and they were really happy to beat us, they thought finally we can beat FaZe and the curse is broken, but we showed this tournament by winning 3-0 when they are on their highest peak, they are playing really good CS, they are all hitting great shots, nobodies really falling off. But we were able to shut them down with the play-style we have, and I think we are always a good counter to Astralis and we will probably see more of the rivalry in the coming months.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Did you guys expect to go 3-0?</p>
<p>Obviously not, I think they have shown great map pool. If you look at the teams right now it is mouz, FaZe and Astralis, they have gained so much from the Cobble removal, so we knew coming into the finals that it was going to be either Cache or Mirage that they were going to veto and I was quite happy they veto-d Mirage so we can play Cache, what I feel we are the best team in the world on, and we removed Nuke so they picked Overpass and thats where I feel like when we won Overpass 'We actually close this out now - as long we get a few round on T-Side, we are going to have a monster CT-side on Train.'</p>

<p class="interview-question">A lot of people in the press room thought that veto from Astralis was arguably the wrong veto, putting yourself into their perspective do you see it as the wrong one?</p>
<p>Yeah I mean, they have improved Cache very much and I think on it against any other team in the world right now, they would have beat the team on Cache. So our Mirage is a bit shaky with Xizt, I know people have been abusing B against us with Xizt playing B on Mirage, so I thought that was coming in, that's what I prepared for. Zero preparation for Cache, I had a read they wouldn't go for it, but once they did I was just so confident the way we play Cache that we have so many ways we can abuse, GuardiaN likes the map, rain is good entry frag and NiKo is the best lurk on the map. So we just feel very comfortable playing it, and I would agree, I think it was the wrong veto, but it always easy to say after. We changed our veto, we maybe did a wrong veto in Marseille by letting Nuke instead of Overpass we chose today, but it is all about the day, how you play and how you feel on the day.</p>

<p class="interview-question">So obviously Olof out at the moment and you got Xizt in instead, is he playing the same sort of roles?</p>
<p>No, so Olof was always kind of a single guy who has to make the decision for himself once we take map control, we leave him and he can be a play-maker like NiKo can. So we always had those two making the plays opposite of the site we went, and we had the trio of me, GaurdiaN and rain taking map control and making sure we did all the things and then form there I could call. With Xizt he has to get used to playing in this single role by himself, he has been what I am an ingame-leader, so he has improved this event as well; how to handle situation, how to call, how to say all the stuff he needs from me. He is playing a more supportive role than Olof did, and maybe that helps us in another way, but we have less kill now, but that is why we have adapted this event as well.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Does it feel better or worse that fact that you know you won this tournament without your full roster?</p>
<p>No, it just means that we are a very good team no matter who we put in as the fifth player. Olof is a big big part of our team, he was one of the reasons we won those tournaments as well, so I think what we are good at is we have so much skill on the team that even if you take one guy out and put Olof in, we will still have a lot of skill on the team, we have a hard-hitting trio. So I think ti doesn't really matter, as long as we don't have three support players, then it's gonna get a little tight. I think we have been playing so well as a team this event, especially after the group-stage or before the Cloud9 game, before that it was really really bad.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Alright, thanks a lot man.</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
