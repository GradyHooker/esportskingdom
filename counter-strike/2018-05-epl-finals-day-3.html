<p class="subheading">Group Yellow - Upper Bracket Round 3 (Winner to Semis, Loser to Quarters)</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/faze.png" alt="Logo for FaZe Clan"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;FaZe Clan&nbsp;&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Natus Vincere&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/navi.png" alt="Logo for Natus Vincere"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">Mirage was FaZe's map pick, and NaVi started on CT. They managed to take the first 3 rounds before FaZe responded with 3 of their own. The next 3 rounds went back and forth between the two teams before FaZe again won 3 in a row. NaVi quickly grabbed a pair of their own, but FaZe snatched the final round of the half to take a narrow 8-7 lead into half. In the second half however NaVi won the first 6 rounds to take a 5 rounds lead. FaZe closed it to 2 with 3 rounds of their own, but NaVi set up map point with another pair of rounds. FaZe was only able to delay map point by 1 round before NaVi won the map 12-16. MVP of the map goes to Denis ‚Äúelectronic‚Äù Sharipov for a 28/2/19 stat line, 100.4 ADR, and a 1.46 Rating.</p>

<p>NaVi chose Nuke for their map, but FaZe managed to get the stronger side, CT, first. This did not disturb NaVi one bit however as they managed to win the first 7 rounds. FaZe dug in their heels though and didn't give another inch in the first half, winning out the remaining 8 rounds to take another narrow 8-7 halftime lead. In the second half, NaVi took their 4th pistol round of the match and translated that into the first 3 rounds of the half. Though FaZe won the 4th round of the half, NaVi reset them and won 5 straight to set up match point at 9-15. FaZe was able to hang on for 3 more rounds before NaVi ended it and secured their spot in the Semifinal. NaVi won map 2 12-16 and the match 0-2. The MVP was again electronic with a 26/1/15 line, 91.9 ADR, and a 1.48 Rating.</p>

<p class="subheading">Group Yellow - Lower Bracket Round 3 (Winner to Quarters)</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/heroic.png" alt="Logo for Heroic"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Heroic&nbsp;&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;&nbsp;mousesports&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/mousesports.png" alt="Logo for mousesports"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">Heroic had first pick, and with it they took Cache. Mouz started on CT, but that did not start to their advantage as Heroic won 6 of the first 7 rounds. Mouz righted the ship by winning the next 6 rounds to take a 6-7 lead, and then traded the last two rounds back and forth with Heroic. This game mouz a narrow 7-8 lead going into the second half. In the second half, mouz started strong with the first 6 rounds going their way. Though Heroic managed to take 2 off of them, mouz then finished the game off with another pair of rounds, winning the game 9-16. Miikka 'suNny' Kemppi gets the MVP for an all around solid performance. He had a 24/1/10 line, 82 ADR, and a 1.45 rating.</p>

<p>With their map choice, mouz took Mirage. Heroic started on CT side and with the pistol round win, but mouz stole the eco round and proceeded to win 8 straight before Heroic found their way back into it. They managed to turn it slightly back in their favor by winning the next 5 rounds, but mouz did win the final round of the half to take a healthy 6:9 lead. In the second half Heroic took their 3rd pistol round of the match, and won 5 of the first 6 rounds in the second half. Mouz was then able to take a pair of rounds but Heroic was not to be out done and took a pair themselves. This set the score at 13-12 Heroic with 5 rounds left to play. Mouz did not remain behind for long winning the next 3 rounds and setting up match point. Heroic however wasn't going down without a fight and ensured the match would go the full 30 regulation rounds by winning round 29. However, they could not send it to OT, and mouz won 14-16, and the match 0-2. The MVP was once again suNny with a 1.46 Rating, 28/6/21 stat line, and a 104.7 ADR.</p>

<p class="subheading">Group Red - Lower Bracket Round 2</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/optic.png" alt="Logo for OpTic Gaming"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;OpTic Gaming&nbsp;&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Space Soldiers&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/spacesoldiers.png" alt="Logo for Space Soldiers"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">OpTic had fist choice of map, and they took Inferno. Space Soldiers ended up on T side to start, but couldn't get much going in the first half. OpTic took the first 4 rounds and 7 of the first 8 before SS finally found their feet by winning 3 in a row. That proved just an illusion of control however as OpTic quickly stole back the momentum and won the remaining 4 rounds of the half to take a strong 11-4 halftime lead. In the second half, OpTic opted to put Space Soldiers out of their misery with 5 quick rounds to win the map in ugly 16-4 fashion. The MVP of the map was Ren√© ‚Äúcajunb‚Äù Borg for his outstanding 2.20 Rating, 29/6/6 stat line, and 136.2 ADR.</p>

<p>Space Soldiers picked Nuke for their map, and despite getting the CT side to start, they never really were in this map either. OpTic won the first 8 rounds before Space Soldiers took 3. Once again this proved to be only a false hope as OpTic took the remaining 4 rounds of the half to take another dominating half time lead of 12-3. Space Soldiers managed to get the pistol round in the second half, but OpTic took the eco and the next 3 rounds to set up match point. Space Soldiers tried to hold them off, but only managed to delay the loss by one round. The final score was 16-5 OpTic and 2-0 for the match. MVP of the map goes to Kristian ‚Äúk0nfig‚Äù Wienecke. He had a game leading 22 kills, 1.67 Rating, and a 108.3 ADR.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/renegades.png" alt="Logo for Renegades"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Renegades&nbsp;&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;&nbsp;SK Gaming&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/skgaming.png" alt="Logo for SK Gaming"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">SK chose Cache for the first map with Renegades on T side to start. SK shot out of the gate by winning the first 8 rounds. Renegades managed to win 3 of the next 4 to stabilize themselves, but the Brazilans were not done yet .They pulled in 2 more rounds before RNG took the final round of the half to go into the second half at a large 4-11 deficit. In the second half, Renegades managed to take the first two rounds, but SK then strung together 4 straight to set up map point 6-15. RNG managed to get one more before SK put knocked em out of the map 7-16. MVP was Fernando ‚Äúfer‚Äù Alvarenga with a 1.82 Rating, 27/6/13 stat line, and a 112.2 ADR.</p>

<p>Map 2 was Renegades choice of Mirage. SK started strong again on CT side, taking the first 5 rounds and all but 2 rounds in the first half. This gave them a nearly insurmountable 2-13 halftime lead. However, Renegades answered the bell for the second half and came out swinging. They won the first 5 rounds and 8 of the first 9 before Sk were able to set up match point at 10-15. RNG was able to put up only 1 more round of resistance before SK delivered the knock-out blow in the form of a fer 2k on entry to close the map and match out. Sk wins the map 11-16 and the match 0-2. Map MVP was on the losing team, because without the heroic play from Justin ‚Äújks‚Äù Savage‚Äù Renegades was likely Dead on Arrival in the second half. He finished with a 101 ADR, 28 kills, and a 1.50 rating.</p>

<p class="subheading">Group Yellow - Lower Bracket Round 3 (Winner to Quarters)</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/skgaming.png" alt="Logo for SK Gaming"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;SK Gaming&nbsp;&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;&nbsp;OpTic Gaming&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/optic.png" alt="Logo for OpTic Gaming"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">First map choice went to SK who picked Train. OpTic started on CT and started fast. They took the first 7 rounds and only gave up 3 rounds the entire first half to build up a formidable 2-13 lead. In the second half SK took the pistol round only to lose the eco. OpTic used this to win the next round as well, but SK did not roll over. They came roaring back with 6 straight rounds before OpTic could set up map point at 10-15. SK did not let it just end though, and won the next 4 rounds to force a round 30 and set up a possible date with OT. Again it was Nicklas ‚Äúgade‚Äù Gade with the heart-crushing 3k to end the comeback hopes of OpTic's opponents and secure them the first map 14-16. MVP of the map goes to Jakob ‚ÄúJUGi‚Äù Hansen for a 1.39 Rating, 91.7 ADR, and 29/4/17 stat line.</p>

<p>Dust 2 was OpTic's pick for map 2, and SK started on CT. Like OpTic in the first map, SK got off to a tremendous start, winning all but 2 of the first half rounds to take an overwhelming 13-2 half time lead. In the second half they won the first two rounds to set up map point at 15-2. OpTic was only able to delay the inevitable for 4 more rounds before losing to SK 16-6. The MVP of the map was Marcelo ‚Äúcoldzera‚Äù David for a 1.66 rating, 27 kills, and a 114.7 ADR. He also had a Kill/Assist/Trade/Survived in all but one round.</p>

<p>What would Professional CS be without a decider match on Inferno? OpTic once more got to start on CT but SK took advantage of the T side to win the first 3 rounds. OG managed to storm back with 5 rounds of their own before dropping another 3 to SK. They then closed the half out with 4 straight rounds of their own to take a healthy 6:9 lead over SK. In the second half OpTic started strong with 3 straight rounds, but SK answered with a pair of their own. OpTic tried to regain control of the match, but all their round win ended up doing was acting as a loss bonus reset and SK won the rest of the rounds of the match to sweep past OpTic into the Quarterfinals with a 16-13 win and a 2-1 match victory. Ricardo ‚Äúboltz‚Äù Prass gets the mvp for a 1.34 rating and 25 kills</p>

<p class="subheading">Group Yellow - Upper Bracket Round 3 (Winner to Semis, Loser to Quarters)</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/liquid.png" alt="Logo for Team Liquid"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Team Liquid&nbsp;&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Astralis&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/astralis.png" alt="Logo for Astralis"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">Astralis chose Nuke for their map, but Liquid was the team to get the coveted CT side first. Though they won the pistol round, Astralis managed to steal the next 3 rounds and won 7 of the first 9. Liquid managed to trade rounds back and forth for a few rounds before winning the final 2 rounds of the half. This gave them a bad 6-9 deficit heading into T side on Nuke, a daunting lead to overcome. Despite this, Liquid came out and won the first 3 rounds to tie the game at 9, but then Astralis replied with 3 of their own. TL tried to make something happen with by taking a single round, but Astralis stamped it out and closed the map in the next 4 rounds. Astralis won Nuke 10-16. Nicolai ‚Äúdevice‚Äù Reedtz takes the MVP for a 1.53 Rating, 25/5/15 stat line, and having the only ADR above 100 at 102.3.</p>

<p>Liquid's map choice was Inferno, and Astralis started on CT. Again Liquid won the pistol round, but again Astralis took the eco round and the next two rounds. In fact, they won all but 3 of the remaining rounds in the half to take a commanding 4-11 halftime lead. Liquid tried to fight back in the second half, even managing to take 3 of the first 4 rounds, but Astralis just ended it with 4 more rounds. They took the map 7-16 and the match 0-2. MVP of the map again goes to device, this time for a 1.63 Rating and 23 kills.</p>

<p>That does it for the Day 2 and 3 Super Recap! Thank you for taking the time to read! I know it was absurdly long!</a></p>
