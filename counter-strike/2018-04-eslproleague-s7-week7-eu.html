      <p>Season 7 of the ESLCS Pro League is fast coming to a close. The last week of the regular season, Week 7, takes place April 24th-26th. That means we have to take a look at each region and determine who is most likely to make it to the Finals in Dallas, May 18th-20th. Yesterday I covered North America, so today's installment focuses on Europe.</p>

<p class="subheading">Tickets Punched</p>
<p>Unlike North America, half of the spots in Europe are already decided. Among the teams who have already clinched a spot at Dallas are Space Soldiers, Ninjas in Pyjamas, Natus Vincere, and Astralis. Any of these teams have a great chance of finishing 1st.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/spacesoldiers.png" alt="Logo for Space Soldiers"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Space Soldiers&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/spacesoldiers.png" alt="Logo for Space Soldiers"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">The Turkish squad Space Soldiers showed up at the Boston Major and did well for the lower expectations the international community had for them, even taking a best of 1 in the New Legends Stage off of the eventual champs, Cloud9. Since then, they have been in decent form, winning the European closed qualifier for ESL One Belo Horizonte, but also dropping out of DreamHack Masters Marseille in the Group Stage. They have racked up a Pro League record of 15-7 with 46 points. Their only losses outside of the top seven have been single games dropped to Fnatic(11th) and Team LDLC.com(Last place). The current lineup has played together since November 2016 and it shows in their great teamwork. In Week 7 they face both FaZe Clan(5th) and mousesports(6th). Both of these teams are in the Top-7, and will be looking to clinch their spot at Dallas.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/nip.png" alt="Logo for Ninjas in Pyjamas"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ninjas in Pyjamas&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/nip.png" alt="Logo for Ninjas in Pyjamas"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">Ninjas in Pyjamas is an iconic Swedish CS organization, but they have not lived up to the lofty teams of the past over the last 2 years. They have missed the last 3 Majors including Boston. However, since Boston, they have a good record, making it to the Quarterfinals of DreamHack Masters Marseille where they lost to Fnatic in three games. They have done well in the Pro League as well, with a 15-9 record and 46 points accumulated. Unfortunately for the Ninjas, they have a habit of playing to the level of their opponent, as, outside of the Top-7 they have lost to HellRaisers(9th), Heroic(10th), Fnatic, Team EnVyUs(12th), and Team LDLC.com. On the other hand, they have sweeps over Space Soldiers(1st), NaVi(3rd), and FaZe Clan. In February they benched Richard 'Xizt' Landstr√∂m and signed Dennis 'dennis' Edman as a replacement, as well as bringing in Faruk 'pita' Pita to replace Bj√∂rn 'THREAT' Pers as coach after Pers resigned. In Week 7 they play Astralis, another team that has already locked up their spot in Dallas. This pairing will go a long way towards deciding who finishes 1st in the region.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/navi.png" alt="Logo for Natus Vincere"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Natus Vincere&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/navi.png" alt="Logo for Natus Vincere"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">The vaunted Ukrainian side of NaVi made it all the way to the Semifinals of the Boston Major before being swept by FaZe Clan. Since then, their results have been good, making it all the way to the Grand Finals of 3 consecutive LANs, though they only won one of them. Most recently they lost in embarrassing fashion to Astralis in the the Grand Finals of Dreamhack Masters Marseille. They sit at 15-7 and 43 points on the season. Their losses outside of the Top-7 came to Heroic and HellRaisers. Despite no roster changes, there was quite a bit of drama that developed around NaVi allegedly requesting such a high buyout from SK for Oleksandr 's1mple' Kostyliev and Egor 'flamie' Vasilyev that the Brazilian side retracted their interest in the pair. Hopefully for NaVi fans, this does not prove to be a distraction as the squad looks to continue its winning ways. In Week 7 they play Fnatic and G2 Esports(8th), both teams that are looking to break into the Top-7 and punch their tickets to Dallas.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/astralis.png" alt="Logo for Astralis"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Astralis&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/astralis.png" alt="Logo for Astralis"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">Astralis, the player-owned Danish organization was eliminated in the New Legends Stage at the Boston Major. They have been in fine form since then, winning the Grand Final of Dreamhack Masters Marseille over NaVi in stunning 2-0 fashion. In the Pro League, they have a record of 14-8 and have picked up 42 points. Their losses outside of the Top-7 have been to AGO Esports(13th), HellRaisers, G2 Esports, as well as being swept by 10th place Heroic. However, like NiP, they play to the level of their opponents, as they have a sweeps over Space Soldiers and FaZe Clan. After the major, the team was stunned by the sudden departure of Markus 'Kjaerbye' Kj√¶rbye for North, and they replaced him with Emil 'Magisk' Reif, a former North player, from Optic Gaming. Astralis plays Team EnVyUs and NiP in Week 7 as they look to secure the top seed in the region.</p>

<p class="subheading">Should Be In</p>
<p>Of the teams in the Top-7 that have not already locked up their spot, mousesports and FaZe Clan both should be in barring any extreme collapses.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/faze.png" alt="Logo for FaZe Clan"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;FaZe Clan&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/faze.png" alt="Logo for FaZe Clan"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">The American-owned European super team performed very well at the Boston ELEAGUE Major, losing in the Grand Final to Cloud9 in a best of 3 that went all the way to the final round of Double OT. There performance since then has been middle of the road, and below expectations for a team of their caliber. They were swept out of the Quarterfinals of Dreamhack Masters Marseille by the eventual champs, Astralis. They sport a 13-11 record with 41 points in Pro League. However, 9 of their losses have come against the Top-7. This is very poor performance against other top-tier talent. On April 1st, the FaZe announced that Olof 'olofmeister' Kajbjer would be taking a personal break, and in his place they are playing Richard 'Xizt' Landstr√∂m as a sub until olofmeister returns. Their poor performance against top talent does not bode well for the team going into Week 7, with their only opponents being Space Soldiers. However, all they need to guarantee their spot in Dallas is a single win, so there is no likely scenario in which they are left out.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/mousesports.png" alt="Logo for mousesports"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;mousesports&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/mousesports.png" alt="Logo for mousesports"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">mousesports was swept out of the Boston Major in the Quarterfinals by FaZe Clan. At Dreamhack Masters Marseille they managed to make it to the Quarterfinals, where they were swept by the Runners-up, NaVi. In the Pro League, they have a deceiving record of 14-8 with 40 points. They have not been swept by any team, but half of their losses have come to teams outside of the Top-7. Many of their wins have also been 16-14 nail-biters or even going into OT. Their inability to put teams away, even below-average teams, may be a problem for them in the future. On the other hand, their refusal to be swept means they might perform well in best of 3's. Their opponents in Week 7 are Team EnVyUs and Space Soldiers. Like FaZe Clan, all they need is a single win to lock in their trip to Dallas.</p>

<p class="subheading">Work To Do</p>
<p>The fact that there are 7 spots in EU instead of 6 means that there are a few more teams that are fighting for the final spot and who have realistic shots at it. North, G2 Esports, and HellRaisers all have a shot at advancing to Dallas.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/north.png" alt="Logo for North"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;North&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/north.png" alt="Logo for North"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">The F.C. Copenhagen owned Danish side was eliminated from the Boston Major's New Legends Stage in 3 straight games, losing to BiG, Astralis and Vega Squadron. Recently they did not qualify for Dreamhack Masters Marseille, losing in the Semifinals of the European Closed Qualifier to Space Soldiers. They have a rather unfortunate record of 12-12 with 35 points, and only 4 wins over Top-7 opponents. After the Major, North went through several changes. They replaced coach Casper 'ruggah' Due with Alexander 'ave' Holdt, dropped Ren√© 'cajunb' Borg for Daniel 'mertz' Mertz, and replaced 'Kristian 'k0nfig' Wienecke with Markus 'Kjaerbye' Kj√¶rbye. This tumultuous time has translated into a team that is still under-performing. In Week 7 they only face HellRaisers, and these are must-win games if they hope to advance. If they can win both, they will lock up their spot, but if they can't win both, they have to hope for help from others in holding off the pack.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/g2.png" alt="Logo for G2 Esports"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;G2 Esports&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/g2.png" alt="Logo for G2 Esports"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">The first French team(Spanish owned) on the list disappointingly was eliminated in the Quarterfinals by eventual Champs Cloud9. This was after sweeping through the New Challengers and New Legends Stages(including a win over C9). At Dreamhack Masters Marseille, the home team was the first to be eliminated, by their French rivals EnVyUs in the first round of eliminations in the Group Stage. In the Pro League, their record is 11-13 with 33 points. Unfortunately for French CS fans, their best hope of reaching Dallas has a dismal 2 wins against the current Top-7, and only 5 wins against the Top-11. At the beginning of March, Richard 'shox' Papillon was replaced by √ìscar 'mixwell' Ca√±ellas on a trial basis, and Edouard 'SmithZz' Dubourdeaux stepped down as coach due to a desire to play again. The team's manager, J√©r√¥me 'NiaK' Sudries stepped in to take over coaching duties. Since the changes, they have won 9 games, this looks promising until you realize  half of those came against bottom 4 talent. Their only Week 7 opponent is NaVi, a poor matchup if they hope to jump North and hold off the rest of the pack to advance. If they don't win both games, they will almost certainly not advance.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/hellraisers.png" alt="Logo for HellRaisers"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;HellRaisers&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/hellraisers.png" alt="Logo for HellRaisers"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">The Ukraine based team did not make the Boston Major. In the meantime, they replaced Krijstan 'FejtZ' Allsaar with the returning Vladyslav 'bondik' Nechyporchuk. In the Pro League they have a record of 10-12 and have accumulated 29 points. However, despite the losing record, they have taken games off of mouseports, NaVi, and Astralis. They have 2 opponents in Week 7, LDLC and North. If they are to advance, they need to at least win 3 out of 4 games, and both game against North. Even then they might not advance if they don't get some help.</p>

<p class="subheading">Left Out</p>
<p>These teams are either mathematically eliminated from the Finals or must have a tremendously statistically improbable set of events to occur in order for them to make it to Dallas.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/heroic.png" alt="Logo for Heroic"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Heroic&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/heroic.png" alt="Logo for Heroic"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">Heroic, while not mathematically eliminated from making it to Dallas have a very statistically improbable requirement to make it. Heroic was swept by upstart Valiance at the European Closed Qualifier for DH Masters Marseille. At 10-12 with 28 points, and games left against AGO and EnVyUs, they would need to sweep and hope for help from other teams to prevent the teams ahead of them from earning points. However, it is not all bad for Heroic. With matches against two of the teams against them, they can easily lock up a spot in Season 8 and avoid the Relegation bracket.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/fnatic.png" alt="Logo for Fnatic"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Fnatic&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/fnatic.png" alt="Logo for Fnatic"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">Fnatic, the other Swedish team, is another team that is not mathematically eliminated from making it to Dallas, but they would need to have a perfect storm of events to occur for them to advance. They sit at 8-12 and only have 25 points to their name. They showed good form at DH Masters Marseille, making it all the way to the Semifinals before being swept by the Champs Astralis. Week 7 they have games against LDLC, AGO, and NaVi. this means they have a very good chance of keeping their spot in Season 8, so long as they take care of AGO and LDLC.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/envyus.png" alt="Logo for Team EnVyUs"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Team EnVyUs&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/envyus.png" alt="Logo for Team EnVyUs"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">The other French team did not even advance out of the New Challengers Stage at the Boston Major, with only a single win over Flash Gaming.  At DH Masters Marseille, this home team eliminated their French brothers, G2 in the first elimination game before being eliminated by FaZe Clan. With a record of 7-13 and only 22 points, they do not have a realistic way to make it into the Top-7. They face Astralis, mouseports, and Heroic in Week 7. They have work to do if they hope to avoid relegation.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/ago-2018.png" alt="Logo for AGO"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;AGO&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/ago-2018.png" alt="Logo for AGO"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">The Polish organization is unfortunately mathematically eliminated from making it to Dallas due to their record of 6-16 and only 19 points. They can only hope to avoid relegation. In Week 7 they have games against Fnatic and Heroic, both of which are teams they need to jump if they want to stay in Pro League for Season 8.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/ldlc.png" alt="Logo for Team LDLC"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Team LDLC&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/ldlc.png" alt="Logo for Team LDLC"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">The electronic store-backed LDLC is mathematically eliminated from Dallas, but they can stay in Pro League. They have a record of 6-16 with 19 points, and they have Fnatic and HellRaisers as opponenets for Week 7. The games against Fnatic are must wins for LDLC if they hope to avoid relegation.</p>

<p class="subheading">Relegated</p>
