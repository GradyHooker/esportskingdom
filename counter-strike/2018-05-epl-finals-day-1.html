<p class="subheading">Group Yellow - Upper Bracket First Round</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/mousesports.png" alt="Logo for mousesports"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;mousesports&nbsp;&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharks Esports&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/sharks.png" alt="Logo for Sharks Esports"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">Inferno was the map that mouz and Sharks met on as the first two teams to play in Dallas. Mouz started on CT, but Sharks Esports came out looking strong, surprising everybody by taking the first 6 rounds of the map, but mouz decided that was enough. Mouz proceeded to win the next 6 rounds, before dropping another pair and winning the final round of the half. This gave a surprising 8-7 lead to the newcomers, Sharks. In the second half though, it was all mouz. Mouz won the pistol, and the next 7 rounds to take go to match point up 8-15. Though Sharks were able to delay the inevitable and win 2 more rounds, they ultimately lost 10-16. They put up a much better fight than expected though. Though his team lost, Raphael “exit” Lacerda” earns the MVP for his tremendous play in the first half, leading to a 24/3/18 stat line, 99.7 ADR, and a 1.44 rating. If not for him, Sharks would not have gone into half with the lead.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/faze.png" alt="Logo for FaZe Clan"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;FaZe Clan&nbsp;&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cloud9&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/cloud9.png" alt="Logo for Cloud9"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">FaZe and C9 ended up playing on Cache for their best of 1. After several minutes of technical difficulties, the game started with C9 on T side. They managed to take the first pistol round behind the heroic 4k of FNS, but that was nearly all he would do the entire game. FaZe proceeded to win the eco-round, and only allowed C9 to win 2 more rounds the entire game. The MVP of the game goes to Nikola “NiKo” Kovač with a scary 2.23 HLTV rating, 27/2/9 stat line, and 141.8 ADR.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/nrg.png" alt="Logo for NRG Esports"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;NRG Esports&nbsp;&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Heroic&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/heroic.png" alt="Logo for Heroic"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">NRG and Heroic played on Mirage, with Heroic on CT side to start. In a surprise, they did not seem to miss a beat despite playing with a stand-in, and playing on short-notice. They won the pistol round the next 5 rounds to take a quick 6-0 lead. It looked like NRG had found their footgin with a quick round win, but Heroic simply reset their economy and won four more to extend their lead to 10-1. Both teams took 2 of the final 4 rounds of the first half for a 12-3 half time score. NRG looked lively in the second half, winning the first pistol round and first 3 rounds in all, but Heroic put an end to that and the game by winning the next 4 rounds, closing the game out 16-6. MVP goes to the other niko, Nikolaj “niko” Kristensen with a 24/6/10 stat line 114.4 ADR and 1.75 HLTV rating.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/navi.png" alt="Logo for Natus Vincere"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Natus Vincere&nbsp;&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;&nbsp;MVP Project&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/mvp.png" alt="Logo for MVP Project"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">The second match in a row to feature Mirage, MVP PK ended up on T side first. This seemed to agree with them, as they won the first three rounds. NaVi then bought weapons and won the next 9 rounds to lead 3-9. MVP stabilized and managed to win the final 3 rounds of the half and go into half with a respectable 6-9 score in favor of NaVi. MVP won the second pistol round as well, though NaVi manged a bomb plant. This proved enough, as NaVi used this money to force and win the eco round. From there out, it was all NaVi, with the European side winning the final 7 rounds for a 7-16 win. MVP for the match was Egor “flamie” Vasilyev with his 21/6/12 stat line, 97,7 ADR, and 1.38 HLTV rating.</p>

<p class="subheading">Group Yellow - Upper Bracket 2nd Round (Best of 3)</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/mousesports.png" alt="Logo for mousesports"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;mousesports&nbsp;&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;&nbsp;FaZe Clan&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/faze.png" alt="Logo for FaZe Clan"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">The first map pick went to FaZe and with it, they chose Overpass. Mouz started on CT side, but FaZe took the first three rounds. Mouz bounced back with a pair of rounds of their own, but FaZe took their 4th before allowihng mouz to win the next 3. With the score 4-5 in favor of mouz, FaZe proceeded to win the rest of the rounds in the half and take a 10-5 half time lead. They again won the pistol round in the second half, but this time mouz took the eco round and the next 5 to tie the map up 11-11. FaZe won 2, but dropped 3 and with only 3 rounds remaining, mouz led 13-14. However, like the first half, FaZe decided to end it, and they won the remaining 3 rounds of the half to take the first map 16-14. The MVP again falls to Nikola “NiKo” Kovač for relentlessly keeping the team afloat with a 28/3/20 stat line, 84.8 ADR and 1.33 HLTV rating.</p>

<p>mouz choose Mirage for their pick, and this time ended up on T side to start. At first this seemed to be exactly what the needed as they took the first 3 rounds, but then FaZe won the next 3 and only lost one more in the half. This gave FaZe a 11-4 lead at half, and unfortunately for mouz, that was as close as it was ever going to get. FaZe won the remainder of the rounds to take the game 16-4. MVP goes to Håvard “rain” Nygaard for a 1.80 HLTV rating, 24/4/8 line, and a healthy 114.8 ADR.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/heroic.png" alt="Logo for Heroic"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Heroic&nbsp;&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Natus Vincere&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/navi.png" alt="Logo for Natus Vincere"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">Heroic's map pick came first with Cache, and they got to start on CT side. It didn't look good for them early though, as NaVi took the first 3 rounds, and 8 of the first 10 rounds. However, Heroic managed to pull it together a little to win 3 of the final 5 rounds and go into the second half only down 6-9. In the second half, the story was flipped. Heroic won the first 5 rounds, and only gave up 2 rounds the entire half. This allowed them to easily close the map out 16-11 over heavily favored NaVi. MVP of the map goes to Jorgen “cromen” Robertsen whose consistent fragging carried the map for Heroic. He finished with a 24/2/17 line 89.8 ADR, and a 1.36 ADR.</p>

<p>The second map was Overpass, NaVi's choice, and again NaVi started on T side. Though Heroic won the first round, NaVi managed to win the next 3 and 5 of the next 7 in total to take a 3-5 lead. Heroic suddenly found their feet again in the 9th round, and they refused to let NaVi back into the half, winning out. They carried a surprising 10-5 lead into the second-half. However, fortunes reversed in the second half. NaVi won the pistol round, and though Heroic won the eco, NaVi took back the third round. They proceeded to only drop 2 more rounds to Heroic the rest of the map to win 13-16. Again Egor “flamie” Vasilyev earns the MVP for great play including a 4k to win the map and send the series to a 3rd map. He had a 25/6/16 stat line, a 94.6 ADR and a 1.42 rating.</p>

<p>The final map left after the ban and pick process was Mirage. For the 3rd map in a row, NaVi started on T side. They won the pistol round, as well as the next 2 rounds. Heroic managed to take two rounds, but NaVi stomped that out and only allowed 1 more round to go the Danes way the first half, taking a commanding 3-12 half time lead. Again however, the second half showcased a reversal of fortunes. Heroic won the first three rounds before dropping a round to NaVi. They then won 9 straight rounds, but could not clinch the 2 match points they were given. Instead map 3 went to Overtime. In OT however, NaVi reminded Heroic who they were and only allowed them to win a single round, taking the map 16-19, and the match 1-2. The MVP of this match was by far Oleksandr “s1mple” Kostyliev. He closed out the match with a 3K and had a 32/4/18 stat line with at 92.9 ADR and a 1.48 Rating. He was also the most consistent fragger throughout the entire series for either team.</p>

<p class="subheading">Group Yellow - Lower Bracket 1st Round (Best of 3)</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/nrg.png" alt="Logo for NRG Esports"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;NRG Esports&nbsp;&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;&nbsp;MVP Project&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/mvp.png" alt="Logo for MVP Project"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">MVP chose Cache for the first map and NRG ended up on T side to start. MVP took the first 4 rounds and 8 of the first 10, but NRG came storming back to win 4 of the final 5 and go into half with a respectable 6-9 deficit to the upstart Koreans. MVP refused to allow that to deter them, and the won the first 6 rounds of the second half to reach map point at 15-6. Though NRG won 4 more rounds, ultimately MVP was able to close out their map pick with a win and a 16-10 score. The MVP for MVP PK was Hyun-Pyo “XigN” Lee who had a very nice 1.53 HLTV rating, a 26/5/17 line, and a 106.3 ADR.</p>

<p>The second map was NRG's choice of Train. MVP PK started on CT side, but the T's took the first 3 rounds. MVP answered back with 3 of their own, but quickly fell behind again as NRG took the next 4 rounds. MVP managed 2 more rounds before NRG won the final 3 rounds of the half to go into the second half with a 10-5 lead. MVP again won the 2nd half pistol round and the next two rounds, but NRG didn't let that get to them, as they closed out the match in the next 6 rounds with a 16-8 score line. MVP of the game was Vincent “Brehze” Cayonte for his steady kills throughout the map. Though others had flashier plays, his constant fragging, 22/4/11 line, 102.6 ADR, and 1.58 Rating were what carried the map for NRG.</p>

<p>The last map standing after picks and bans ended up being Mirage. MVP started on T side, but it's almost like they never really got started. NRG only allowed MVP 2 rounds the entire map, winning in brutal 16-2 fashion. MVP goes to Tsvetelin “ceRq” Dimitrov with a tidy 18/7/6 stat line, 109.5 ADR and 1.84 Rating. However his most impressive stat was that he had an impact in every single round as shown by his 100% KAST(rounds in which he had a Kill, Assist, Survived, or was traded).</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/cloud9.png" alt="Logo for Cloud9"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cloud9&nbsp;&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharks Esports&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/sharks.png" alt="Logo for Sharks Esports"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">Sharks had the first choice of map, and with it they chose Cache. C9 started on CT like they did against FaZe, and again they took the pistol round. This time they also took the 2nd round. Sharks then managed to take 2 rounds before trading a pair of rounds back and forth with C9. With the score line tied at 3, C9 won the next 2 rounds, then proceeded to lose 4 in a row. Sharks could not keep their foot to the gas though, and Cloud9 managed to win another pair of rounds to tie it up again at 7 all. Sharks took the final round of the first half to take a 7-8 lead into the second half. The second half was no different from the first, though the streaks were slightly longer. Sharks won the first 2 rounds, but C9 responded with 7 of the next 8. This game them a 14-11 lead, but Sharks quickly took the lead by winning the next 4. C9 won the final round of regulation to send the match to OT. In OT, both sides won 3 rounds in the first OT to send it to a second OT. The second OT went all the way down to the final round before Sharks prevailed, 20-22. MVP goes to Rodrigo “RCF” Figueiredo with a 34/11/31 stat line, 1.26 Rating, and a 93.9 ADR.</p>

<p>Cloud9 chose Mirage for their pick and Sharks started on T side. Though C9 managed to win the first pistol round, they lost the anti-eco. Sharks then won 4 of the next 5 to take a 2-5 lead into round 8. In round 8, C9 reasserted it's control of the half and they never let go, winning the remainder of the rounds to take a 10-5 halftime lead. In the second half, they again won the pistol round. This time they won the anti-eco and the following round to expand their lead all the way to 13-5. After trading a round back and forth with Sharks, the upstart Brazilian squad managed to win 5 straight. This gave brought them within 3 at 14-11, but that was as close as they would get, as Cloud9 won the next two rounds to close map 2 out 16-11. MVP goes to Tarik “tarik” Celik for a 1.79 HLTV rating, 31/7/17 stat line, and 112.6 ADR.</p>

<p>The decider map for the match was Inferno, and unfortunately for Sharks, they did not have the same luck they had on it against mouz. C9 started on T side and refused to allow Sharks into the game, only giving up a single round the entire map. They won 16-1. The MVP goes to Timothy “autimatic” Ta for a 18/1/5 line, 91.6 ADR, and a 1.91 Rating.</p>

<p class="subheading">Group Red - Upper Bracket First Round</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/liquid.png" alt="Logo for Team Liquid"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Team Liquid&nbsp;&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Grayhound Gaming&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/grayhound.png" alt="Logo for Grayhound Gaming"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">Liquid and Grayhound ended up on Cache with Liquid starting on CT side. The American team took the first three rounds, but the Aussies fought back with a pair of rounds of their own. The next 4 rounds went back and forth to set up a 10th round with a score of 5-4 in favor of TL. Liquid then proceeded to win the rest of the rounds of the second half with relative ease, taking an 11-4 lead. In the second half, they won the first 4 rounds to make it to match point. Though Grayhound managed to pick up one round off of Liquid in the second half, they ultimately succumbed to the NA 1 seed 16-5. Jonathan “EliGE” Jablonowski was by far the best player in the match with a 27/7/7 stat line, 122 ADR and impressive 1.95 Rating.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/spacesoldiers.png" alt="Logo for Space Soldiers"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Space Soldiers&nbsp;&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Renegades&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/renegades.png" alt="Logo for Renegades"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">Inferno was the battleground for this match, and Space Soldiers wound up starting on T side. They also wound up taking the first 3 rounds before Renegades responded with 3 of their own. SS did not let them continue that streak, taking back momentum with a 6 round win streak and 8 of the final 9 in the half. This gave the Space soldiers a commanding 11-4 lead at half. In the second half the Renegades came out swinging and won the first 3 rounds, but it was just too little too late. Space Soldiers closed the match out with 5 more rounds, winning 16-7 with ease despite missign CALYX. MVP goes to Engin “MAJ3R” Küpeli and his 1.61 rating, 24/1/11 line, and 86.7 ADR.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/optic.png" alt="Logo for OpTic Gaming"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;OpTic Gaming&nbsp;&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Astralis&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/astralis.png" alt="Logo for Astralis"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">The Danish Derby was fought on Nuke, and OpTic got CT side first. However, Astralis reminded everyone who the premier Danish team was, winning the first 10 rounds and 13 in the first half. Though OpTic took the 2nd half pistol round, it was far too little far too late, as Astralis ended it in the next 3 rounds, 16-3. MVP goes to Emil “Magisk” Reif as he managed to out kill his teammate Xyp9x with 21/3/9 stat line, 107 ADR, and a 1.91 Rating.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/skgaming.png" alt="Logo for SK Gaming"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;SK Gaming&nbsp;&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ninjas in Pyjamas&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/nip.png" alt="Logo for Ninjas in Pyjamas"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">Once again Inferno became the battleground for the first round match between NiP and SK. NiP started on CT, but SK took the first pistol. NiP responded by winning the eco and the next two rounds before trading a pair back and forth with SK to put the score at 2-4 NiP. SK and NiP then traded 3 round win streaks to give SK an 8-7 half-time lead. SK again won the pistol in the second half, this time securing the anti-eco and the next round as well, extending their lead to 11-7. After trading a pair of rounds back and forth, NiP then won 3 straight to bring the score within 1 at 12-11 SK. SK did their best to re-extend their lead though, and won 3 of the next 4, placing themselves on match point at 15-12 with 3 rounds left. NiP refused to back down and won the next 3 rounds to force OT. In OT though, it was nearly all SK, as NiP only managed to win a single round. SK won 19-16(4-1 in OT). Marcelo “coldzera” David was easily the MVP with 32/10/21 stat line 89.9 ADR, and a 1.41 HLTV Rating.</p>
