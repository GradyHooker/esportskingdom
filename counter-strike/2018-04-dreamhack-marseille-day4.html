      <p>The Quarterfinals are done on day 4 of Dreamhack Masters Marseille at Le Dôme de Marseille. I went 1-3 on the day, for a record of 5-5 over 3 days of Best of 3's.</p>

<p class="subheading">Quarterfinal #1</p>

<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/navi.png" alt="Logo for Natus Vincere"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Natus Vincere&nbsp;&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;&nbsp;mousesports&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/mousesports.png" alt="Logo for mousesports"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">Map 1 took place on Mirage at mousesports choice, with NaVi starting on CT side. NaVi took the first pistol round and never really looked back in the first half, only giving up 3 rounds to mousesports out of 15. The only time mouz won a round was when an individual player went off and carried the team. In the second half, NaVi again took the pistol round. This time however, mouz took the eco. NaVi quickly returned serve and won the next two round to put them on game point 15-4. Mouz didn't go down without a fight, but ultimately it was in vain, as NaVi won 16-9 in a game that was much more lopsided than the score would suggest. Who other than s1mple would be the MVP? He got his team off to a tremendous start with a 3k on the first pistol round and ended with a 27/6/15 stat line, 112.3 ADSR and a 1.65 rating. This was a tough call though, as electronic went kill for kill with s1mple and had a few big plays of his own.</p>

<p>NaVi choose Inferno for their map, and mouz took CT and the first 2 rounds. NaVi answered back with a pair of their own. The back and forth of streaks continued, 3 for mouz, then 3 for NaVi, then back to 3 more for mouz. NaVi ended the madness of the first half with 2 round wins to close out the half, 8-7 in favor of mouz. Mouz again won the pistol round in the second half, but NaVi took the next 4 after winning an eco. They dropped round 20, but then too the next 4 to take a 15-10 round lead. Mouz did not go quietly. They came back and won the final 5 rounds to send the map to OT, unfortunately, Mouz could only manage a single round as NaVi closed out the game 19-16. This time there was no doubt at all who the MVP was. S1mple put his team on his back and carried them to victory here. He had an ace, posted an absurd 42/8/22 stat line with 116.1 ADR, and had a great 1.73 rating.</p>

<p>I doubted s1mple's ability to just keep performing at the level he has been. Shame on me. Though I still have reservations about NaVi's ability to win without s1mple at his best, I think that he will certainly be playing at his best the rest of the tournament. As for mouz...I put my faith in you after burning me yesterday...and you burnt me again today. Go home, figure out what needs to be sorted out and come back stronger. They are a good side, but they need a bit of work.</p>

<p class="subheading">Quarterfinal #2</p>

<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/cloud9.png" alt="Logo for Cloud9"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cloud9&nbsp;&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gambit Esports&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/gambit.png" alt="Logo for Gambit Esports"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">Cloud9 choose one of their best maps, Mirage to start the match. Gambit started on CT and won the first three rounds before C9 picked up 3 of their own. Gambit went on to dominate the rest of the half, only giving C9 the final round, setting up a 11-4 halftime lead for Gambit. In the second half, Gambit again won the first three rounds. C9 took two off of the CIS squad before they moved to game point 15-6. However, Gambit just could not close the deal, as C9 won out the remaining 9 rounds in regular time to tie it up and send it to OT. It took double OT to decide out winner, but ultimately, Gambit prevailed 22-18. AdreN gets the MVP for his 34/7/22 stats and a 1.23 rating, as well as very good overtime performance.</p>

<p>For map 2, Gambit choose Train, and C9 started on T side. Gambit won the first 5 rounds before C9 took a single round. Then Gambit won another 6 rounds in a row. Finally, C9 seemed to find some momentum and won the final 3 rounds of the half to again go to the second half at 11-4 in Gambit's favor. The second half, Gambit again won the pistol round and the ensuing 3 rounds to reach match point at 15-4. C9 was able to stall them for 3 more rounds, but the 4th proved to be the end as Gambit won and secured the match 16-7. This time, the MVP was much closer, but in the end I had to give it to Dosia. He had a quad kill clutch and an anti-eco 4k as well as a 22/5/12 stat line with a perfect 100 ADR and a 1.46 rating.</p>

<p>Gambit again took down a North American foe, much to the chagrin of American fans. However, in doing so, they looked shaky at closing out matches. Cloud9 did a tremendous job of fighting back from being down, but they just did now play well overall. Hopefully with time, the switch to FNS will become a smoother transition.</p>

<p class="subheading">Quarterfinal #3</p>

<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/astralis.png" alt="Logo for Astralis"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Astralis&nbsp;&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;&nbsp;FaZe Clan&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/faze.png" alt="Logo for FaZe Clan"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">A third quarterfinal featured Mirage as it's first map, as FaZe choose the map, and Astralis started on T side. FaZe won the pistol round and the eco, but were not able to suppress Astralis on the third round. Astralis won 3 straight before giving another 3 away to FaZe. That was when Astralis turned it up and won 6 of the final 7 rounds to go into half leading 9-6. FaZe again took the pistol round in the second half, but this time Astralis beat them in the eco. FaZe quickly responded with the next 3 rounds to tie it at 10 all. Astralis proceeded to game point only dropping one more round. The final score of 16-11 was a good team performance for Astralis, with every player outperforming the other team. The MVP goes to device with a 23/5/15 K/A/D and a 1.48 rating.</p>

<p>Game 2 took place on Nuke as Astralis' choice and FaZe starting on T Side. Though Astralis took the pistol round, they dropped the eco, and 3 of the next 4 to go down 4-2. They didn't let that get to them, and they won all but 1 of the remaining rounds in the half. Going into the second half with momentum and a 10-5 lead, Astralis came out strong, winning the first 5 rounds. Though they lost one more round, they closed the game 16-6 in an absolute rout of FaZe. MVP easily goes to Xyp9x. He had a tremendous 120.7 ADR and a 1.83 rating.</p>

<p>FaZe did not look like the supposed best team in the world. Astralis continues their absolutely soaring form, playing both tremendous team play and having individuals step up when needed.</p>

<p class="subheading">Quarterfinal #4</p>

<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/nip.png" alt="Logo for Ninjas in Pyjamas"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ninjas in Pyjamas&nbsp;&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fnatic&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/fnatic.png" alt="Logo for Fnatic"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">Fnatic had the first map pick, and once again it was Mirage. NiP started on T side, but that did not help them. Fnatic picked up the pistol round and the next 5 before hey dropped a pair to NiP. This was only a minor hiccup for Fnatic though, and they won 6 of the final 7 in the half, taking a commanding 12-3 half time lead. NiP responded well in the second half winning the first 6 rounds. Unfortunately, it was too little too late, and Fnatic closed the match out in the next 4 rounds, winning 16-9. The score does not look nearly as bad as the game actually was. NiP was completely outclassed in this game. JW earned the MVP with a 25/9/18 stat line 114.1 ADR and a great 1.56 rating.</p>

<p>NiP took Inferno as their map pick and very quickly showed Fnatic why. NiP won the first 7 rounds before Fnatic took one from T side. The next three went to NiP before Fnatic finally strung three rounds together. However, NiP closed the half out with a round win, an 11-4 lead, and the momentum. In the second half, NiP jumped out again with 3 quick rounds. Though they gave up a single round in the second half, NiP then won out, closing the game at a brutal 16-5. REZ was the MVP with a 23/3/11 stat line and a 1.63 rating.</p>

<p>The match was decided on Train. Fnatic ended up on T side and won the first three rounds. However, NiP bounced back in tremendous fashion, winning the next 9 rounds. Fnatic took 2 of the final 3 rounds of the half to close NiP's lead to 10-5 at half. NiP won the pistol round, but Fnatic took the eco and three rounds after, closing the gap even further to 11-8. NiP took a round, but then Fnatic threw it into another gear. They took the lead 12-13 before NiP stopped them and tied it up at 13 all. However, that was all NiP would get, as Fnatic closed the game and the match with 3 straight rounds, 16-13. MVP wasn't even a contest, as KRIMZ finished with a 1.70 rating, 110.2 ADR, 31/5/17 stat line, and several key plays.</p>

<p>Both teams looked weak on their opponents map choice, but Fnatic showed its grit and ground out a win on Train despite being down big after the first half. NiP, who had played mistake-free until the Quarterfinals, made far too many mistakes if they wished to win.</p>

<p class="subheading">Semifinals Predictions</p>

<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/navi.png" alt="Logo for Natus Vincere"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Natus Vincere&nbsp;&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gambit Esports&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/gambit.png" alt="Logo for Gambit Esports"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">NaVi looked amazing today, with s1mple continuing to pull out stunning performance after stunning performance. Gambit, though they won in 2 games, looked very shaky at times, especially when they let Cloud9 come back on Mirage. NaVi overpowers Gambit in 2.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/astralis.png" alt="Logo for Astralis"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Astralis&nbsp;&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fnatic&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/fnatic.png" alt="Logo for Fnatic"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">Astralis and Fnatic both looked very good against their respective opponents today. Though Fnatic did leave much to be desired on NiP's map pick of Mirage. Astralis is just playing far too well lately. I keep doubting Fnatic and they keep proving me wrong, but this time I just don't see Astralis losing to them in the form they are in. Astralis in 3.</p>
