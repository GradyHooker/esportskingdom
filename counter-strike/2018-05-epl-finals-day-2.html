<p class="subheading">Group Yellow - Lower Bracket Round 2</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/cloud9.png" alt="Logo for Cloud9"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cloud9&nbsp;&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Heroic&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/heroic.png" alt="Logo for Heroic"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">The first map was Heroic's pick of Mirage and Cloud9 getting to start on CT side. Heroic started off strongly with the first pistol round and the next two rounds, but in the first traditional gun round for the CT's, Cloud9 was able to take back the momentum and go on a 6 round winning streak. Though they dropped another round to Heroic, they were able to pick up two more before Heroic closed out the half with a hat trick of rounds. This put the half time score at a very close 8-7 in favor of Cloud9. Though Cloud9 won the pistol round in the second half, it seems as if the T side did not agree with them. Heroic won the eco, and then another 6 straight to take a 9-14 lead. Cloud9 managed to take another pair of rounds off the Danes, but Heroic then put it away by winning the final two rounds of the map. MVP of the map goes to the stand-in Jorgen ‚ÄúCromen‚Äù Robertsen. He had an HLTV rating of 1.44, a stat line of 26/5/18, and a crisp 100.9 ADR.</p>

<p>Cloud9 got to pick map 2, and with their pick, they chose Overpass. This time Heroic started on CT side, but once again it was the T side that won the first three rounds. Then, like the first game, the CT side took the first traditional gun round and Heroic went on a 9 round streak before C9 was able to right the ship. The Americans took the final 3 rounds of the half, but went into the second half down 6-9. In the second half, it was almost all Heroic. They won the first 3 rounds, and though C9 took 1 round, they were quickly reset and that spelled the end as Heroic won out, closing the game out 7-16 and the match 0-2. Again the stand-in was the stand-out for the MVP. Cromen had a 24/7/15 stat line, 124.9 ADR, and a 1.64 HLTV rating.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/mousesports.png" alt="Logo for mousesports"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;mousesports&nbsp;&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;&nbsp;NRG Esports&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/nrg.png" alt="Logo for NRG Esports"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">NRG picked Cache for the first map of the contest, and mouz ended up on CT to start. They also started by taking the first 3 rounds. NRG was able to stop the bleeding a bit by winning the next 2 rounds, but mouz quickly took back the initiative. They won 6 in a row and 7 of the next 8 to take a 10-3 lead. NRG was able to win the final two rounds of the half to limp into the second half down 10-5. In the second half, NRG took the first five rounds, and 8 of the first 9 to overtake mouz 11-13. Mouz did not falter in the face of this onslaught as they managed to find their footing in the second half and win the next 4 rounds to put them on match point. NRG fought valiantly and took the next round to make the score 15-14 going into the final round of regulation, but oskar crushed all dreams of OT with a 3k to win the map. For that 3k and his overall performance, Tom√°≈° ‚Äúoskar‚Äù ≈†≈•astn√Ω earns the MVP. He finished the map with a 1.36 rating, narrowly edging out suNNy for top rating in the game, a 24/3/17 stat line, and a 79.7 ADR.</p>

<p>Nuke was the 2nd map, and the pick of mousesports. NRG started on CT side, a beneficial start on a very CT-sided map. They were able to convert that start into winning the first 4 rounds. Mouz did not let their own map pick get away from them though, and they pulled in the next 3 rounds. Then the sides traded 4 round win streaks to close the half with NRG owning a narrow 7-8 lead. The second half was a completely different affair. Mouz won the first 4 rounds and only allowed NRG to take 2 rounds in total in the second half. This gave them a map win at 16-10 and a match win at 2-0. MVP was very hard to decide,but ultimately it goes to Miikka 'suNny' Kemppi. He had an amazing 4k hold, a 1.61 Rating, 24/8/14 stat line and a smooth 105.2 ADR.</p>

<p class="subheading">Group Red - Lower Bracket Round 1</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/grayhound.png" alt="Logo for Grayhound Gaming"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Grayhound Gaming&nbsp;&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Renegades&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/renegades.png" alt="Logo for Renegades"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">Grayhounds picked first and chose Overpass. Renegades got the CT side, and the first 3 rounds. Grayhound bounced back and quickly took the next 5, but that was all they would get in the first half, as Renegades won the remaining 7 rounds. With a 5-10 lead going into the second half, Renegades again took the first three rounds. Grayhound suddenly found life and went on an 8 round winning streak to pull even at 13 rounds each. However Renegades decided it was time to end it, and put away the final 3 rounds to win 13-16. MVP of the map was easily Joakim ‚Äújkaem‚Äù Myrbostad and his very impressive 1.96 HLTV Rating, 38/4/18 stat line, and 131.1 ADR.</p>

<p>Renegades decided on Cache for their pick for map 2, and Grayhound started on CT. This did not benefit them as Renegades took the first 5 rounds, and 9 of the first 10. Grayhound was able to somewhat salvage the half by winning 4 of the final 5 rounds, but they still went into half at a 5-10 deficit. In the second half Renegades picked up again and won the first four rounds. Grayhound was able to delay match point for 2 rounds, and then they put up another 3 before Renegades finally closed the map at 10-16 and the match 0-2. MVP for this map goes to the honorary Aussie, Noah ‚ÄúNifty‚Äù Francis for posting a 27/6/17 stat line, a 94.4 ADR, and a 1.42 Rating.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/optic.png" alt="Logo for OpTic Gaming"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;OpTic Gaming&nbsp;&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ninjas in Pyjamas&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/nip.png" alt="Logo for Ninjas in Pyjamas"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">OpTic chose Mirage for map 1 and NiP ended up on CT to start. Though OpTic won the pistol, NiP cheekily won the eco round, but their success was short lived. OG won the next 3 rounds and 5 of the next 6 to take a 6-2 lead. NiP managed to fight back a bit with a 3 round streak of their own, but once again OpTic refused to back down, again taking 3 rounds in a row. NiP was able to take the final round of the half to escape into half with a manageable 9-6 deficit to OpTic. In the second half, OpTic took the first 4 rounds and only allowed NiP one round the entire half, closing out the game after only 223 rounds with a 16-7 scoreline. MVP of the map was Jakob ‚ÄúJUGi‚Äù Hansen with a 26/4/11 stat line, 94 ADR and a very nice 1.69 Rating.</p>

<p>NiP's choice was Inferno, and OpTic started on CT this map. They also too the first 3 rounds and 9 of the first 10 to storm out to a commanding lead. NiP however did not roll over, and won the remaining 5 rounds of the half to again go into half down 9-6. In the second half, OpTic again took the pistol, however NiP was able to take the eco from them. This did not really work out, as OpTic proceeded to win the next 3 rounds. NiP shot right back with a trio of rounds of their own and then the teams traded rounds back and forth until OpTic reached match point at 15-11. NiP was able to win the next 3 rounds to send it to the final round of regulation 15-14 in favor of OpTic and a chance to send it into OT. Then Nicklas ‚Äúgade‚Äù Gade got 2 kills on an entry frag and the final round went downhill from there for NiP. OpTic secured the map 16-14, and the match 2-0. MVP of the map was Kristian ‚Äúk0nfig‚Äù Wienecke for a 1.45 Rating, 94.2 ADR, and 28/3/17 stat line. He also opened 6 rounds with kills to put his team at an advantage. This was significant in the team winning the map.</p>

<p class="subheading">Group Red - Upper Bracket Round 2</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/spacesoldiers.png" alt="Logo for Space Soldiers"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Space Soldiers&nbsp;&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Team Liquid&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/liquid.png" alt="Logo for Team Liquid"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">Map 1 was Space Soldiers' pick of Mirage and Liquid ended up on CT side to start. This seemed to backfire at first as SS won the first two rounds, however Liquid then proceeded to put on a clinic by shutting the Turkish side out of the rest of the half to take a dominating 2-13 lead into the second half. Space Soldiers again took the pistol round in the second half, and the first 4 rounds. Though Liquid managed to take the 20th round, SS won the next 2 before Liquid could set up map point at 8-15. The pride of Turkey managed to take another 3 rounds before Liquid finally secured the map 11-16. Though his team lost, Ismailcan ‚ÄúXANTARES‚Äù D√∂rtkarde≈ü earns the MVP, because without him, this would have been an extremely lopsided defeat for Space Soldiers. He had a 24/3/21 stat line, 97.2 ADR, and a 1.32 Rating.</p>

<p>Liquid picked Inferno for map 2 and Space Soldiers started on CT and took the pistol round. However, with the money from the bomb plant, Liquid was able to force round 2 and win it and the next round. SS quickly responded with a 4 round streak. Then the two teams both had a pair of rounds go their way before Liquid closed out the half on a 4 win streak to go into half up 7-8. In the second half, there was no mercy from Team Liquid. They won 8 straight rounds to clinch the map 7-16 and match 0-2. MVP of map 2 was Keith ‚ÄúNAF‚Äù Markovic for his 1.59 Rating, 24/813 stat line, and solid 107.5 ADR.</p>


<p style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/skgaming.png" alt="Logo for SK Gaming"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;SK Gaming&nbsp;&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Astralis&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class="logo logo-tiny" src="/assets/logos/tiny/astralis.png" alt="Logo for Astralis"/></p>

<p style="padding-top: 0px;">SK's pick was Inferno, and Astralis was on CT to start. They dominated the first half by taking first 5 rounds and only letting SK have 2 rounds the whole half, taking a 2-13 lead into the second half. In the second half, Astralis took the pistol round again, but this time SK managed to steal the eco. This sent them on a 9 round winning streak. Their hopes of a comeback were then stomped out by a pair of rounds including a 3k entry by Emil ‚ÄúMagisk‚Äù Reif on game point to close the game 11-16. Magisk was the clear MVP with a 1.46 rating and 26/2/12 stat line.</p>

<p>With SK's map in hand, Astralis moved onto their pick of Overpass for map 2. SK started on the CT side which is the traditionally stronger side on this map. Astralis again took the pistol round, but SK were once more able to secure the second round. This allowed them to win 5 straight before Astralis could recover. However, once they recovered, they punished SK by winning 8 of the final 9 rounds of the half to take a healthy 6-9 lead into half. In the second half, their momentum did not falter, and they won the first 5 rounds to take a 6-14 lead. SK was able to sneak in a round before Astralis set up match point, but they were only able to hold of the super Danes for 3 more rounds before they ended the map and match. Astralis won the map 10-16 and the match 0-2. The overwhelming MVP for the map was Peter ‚Äúdupreeh‚Äù Rasmussen with a very good 1.92 Rating, 30/6/13 stat line, and a 123.8 ADR.</p>

<p>That's it for Day 2! Every match was a 2-0 sweep, though a few were ‚Äúcompetitive‚Äù sweeps. <a href="2018-05-epl-finals-day-3">Now on to Day 3!</a></p>
