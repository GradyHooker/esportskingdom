<p class="interview-question">Grady: First off, congratulations for getting out onto the stage and getting in front of this big Australian crowd. How was the Australian crowd.</p>
<p>ropz: It was good. I mean overall the crowd was probably against us, we had to play Renegades so that is understandable, they are obviously going to cheer them and we had to take them down to get to the semifinals. It sucks for the crowd that they can't cheer on their home team anymore, but we had to do what we had to do.</p> 

<p class="interview-question">Does it factor into you guys at all that fact you are playing out there as the villains?</p>
<p>Not really. We have played a lot on quite big stages now and most of the time the crowd is against us and we are almost used to it now. We don't really have a home crowd ourselves, we are a really international team and we are from all over the place. So we are just getting used to it and we are just not putting our minds to it.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Being an international team and everyone coming from different backgrounds, have you found that it is easy to mesh as a team or is there cultural differences?</p>
<p>The skill-set is definitely better, but it is harder to mesh together. Everyone has different cultural backgrounds and everyone is used to different schedules, whatever in their life, it is just so different. It's basically like work for us, so we do what we have to do.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Do you feel being an international team, rather than more of a region-locked team, gives you the opportunity to branch out and grab players?</p>
<p>Yeah definitely, there is so many skilled and talented players out there. If you share the same mindset and you want to win, then definitely it's the better thing.</p>

<p class="interview-question">You guys also recently for ESL Pro league, top of the board, ready to go to Dallas. What are your expectations heading there?</p>
<p>We definitely want to get out of groups, that's like the main thing. Overall our main goal right now is to remain consistent and getting out of groups every event and that's what we are trying to do.</p>

<p class="interview-question">So if you had to choose between remaining consistent and getting out of groups every tournament or, because a lot of the teams now are hit and miss, you win a tournament and then you are out in last place the next one. So would you prefer that consistently in the middle approach or up and down.</p>
<p>I think the middle approach is better - you are just consistent all the time, because then there isn't really that many up and downs and you start to feel better as a team and then eventually you have to start being consistent at winning also. Time will tell how good you will become.</p>

<p class="interview-question">You played a couple of the Asian teams here in this tournament and jumping over to ESL Pro League, they have expanded to include Asia-Pacific. Do you approach playing these that you haven't necessarily played day-in and day-out any differently?</p>
<p>Not really, we have our usual preparations to each match. We take a look at the opponent, watch a demo or something and analyze what we can do, what their weak-spots are. There isn't that much difference to a normal team, just depends on the teams play-style and so on.</p>

<p class="interview-question">A lot of the other teams here talking about how they didn't have too much practice for this, or preparation for this specific tournament. How much did you guys have as a team?</p>
<p>We didn't have that much practice, one of our members STYKO had eye surgery recently so he had to not play on some days and we had a lot of online matches. I think thats the biggest part of nowadays CS, online matches take up a lot of time and then you have less time for practice, the schedule is pretty tough nowadays. We came here with enough preparation in this tournament, we finished semifinals so thats pretty good.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Dust2 being added to the map pool, did you have much preparation on that map specifically?</p>
<p>We started preparing the day it came into the map pool, so I'd say we had pretty good preparation on the map. Obviously we picked it against Astralis, we thought it would be a good pick, but they were prepared pretty good and they just shut us down. We had some good starts and so on, but we just couldn't get our defaults going, they just picked us on every part of the map.</p>

<p class="interview-question">There is not many players around from your country, do you feel every time you go out their and see your countries flag up on the screen - that the country is on your back and you're representing them?</p>
<p>Yeah definitely, I've come a long way out of nowhere basically and I think that is the perfect thing, everyone is supporting me and I've had these goals to become a pro and everyone has seen my determination and my mindset. I would say I have some fans out there.</p>

<p class="interview-question">So being on mousesports is a pay-off for everything trying to get up to here?</p>
<p>Yeah, mousesports has a really long history in CS and it feels really good to be on a team like this and with these names. So yeha it is a good thing.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Thanks a lot man.</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
